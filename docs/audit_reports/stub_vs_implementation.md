# Stub vs Implementation Audit

**Generated:** Phase 1 Step 1, Engine Production Readiness ferment
**Scope:** All 10 domain crates (`crates/domains/*/src/services.rs`)
**Methodology:** For each `pub fn`/`pub async fn`, cross-reference against
`docs/specs/<domain>/aggregates.md` invariants. Classify as:
- **real** — validation/transition logic present, spec invariant enforced
- **partial** — some logic but missing spec coverage (notes gap)
- **stub** — returns `NotSupported`/`TODO`/`unimplemented!()`, no logic

## Summary

| Domain | Functions | Real | Partial | Stub |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| attendance | 17 | 8 | 5 | 4 |
| academic | 37 | 11 | 12 | 14 |
| assessment | 72 | 12 | 25 | 35 |
| communication | 104 | 22 | 69 | 13 |
| documents | 18 | 15 | 3 | 0 |
| facilities | 60 | 41 | 19 | 0 |
| finance | 66 | 29 | 5 | 32 |
| hr | 49 | 17 | 6 | 26 |
| library | 37 | 19 | 3 | 15 |
| cms | 33 | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| **TOTAL** | **493** | **193 (39%)** | **154 (31%)** | **139 (28%)** |

**Key findings:**
- **assessment (49% stub) and finance (48% stub)** are the most-stubbed domains
- **documents (0% stub) and facilities (0% stub)** are the most complete
- **hr (53% stub)** has the largest Cluster C handler-skeleton block
- **communication has the most functions (104)** but a high partial rate (66%)
  due to factory-vs-spec signature drift

**Drives Phase 2:** All stubs need real implementations per spec.
All partials need missing invariant/validation/transition coverage.

---

## Per-domain sections



- **real** — the function implements every spec invariant the
  command is responsible for. Missing checks are nil.
- **partial** — the function implements at least one spec invariant
  but is missing others that the spec requires (auth checks, future-
  date validation, cross-aggregate lookups, etc).
- **stub** — the function carries self-documented "Phase 5 stub"
  placeholders (synthetic ids, epoch dates, fixed `false` returns)
  or is annotated for downstream resolution.

Spec invariants are drawn from
`docs/specs/<domain>/aggregates.md`.

## attendance

**Crate:** `crates/domains/attendance/src/services.rs`
**Function count:** 17
**Stub count:** 4 (one of which is `AttendanceService::is_late`)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| `mark_student_attendance` (line 108) | StudentAttendance unique by `(school_id, student_id, attendance_date)`; `is_absent` derives from `attendance_type`; notes length validated | partial | Uniqueness via `uniqueness.student_day_exists` at `services.rs:122-125`; notes via `validate_notes` at `services.rs:118-120`; `is_absent` set from `attendance_type.is_absent()` at `services.rs:138`. **Missing:** invariant 2 (future-date check), invariant 6 (class-section must match student's `StudentRecord`), invariant 7 (`Attendance.Mark`/`Attendance.Update` RBAC). |
| `update_student_attendance` (line 182) | Updates append a new event; latest row replaces prior state; `no_changes` rejected | real | Field-level change tracking at `services.rs:195-203`; `no changes` rejection at `services.rs:213-216`; version bump at `services.rs:209`; `StudentAttendanceUpdated` event minted at `services.rs:217-224`. |
| `bulk_mark_student_attendance` (line 259) | Per-student uniqueness on `(school, student, date)`; roster-aware default-status emission for unmarked students | stub | Self-documented Phase 5 stub: "the service emits a single `default_type` aggregate per (class, section, date) for the unmarked students" at `services.rs:295-302`. The default aggregate uses a placeholder `StudentId` / `StudentRecordId` derived from the event UUID (`services.rs:308-311`) — real roster resolution is deferred to the dispatcher. `uniqueness` parameter is unused (`services.rs:262`). |
| `mark_subject_attendance` (line 486) | SubjectAttendance unique by `(school, student, subject, date)`; subject must be assigned to student's class-section | partial | Uniqueness via `uniqueness.subject_day_exists` at `services.rs:500-504`; notes via `validate_notes` at `services.rs:496-498`. **Missing:** invariant 2 (subject-to-class-section assignment lookup). |
| `update_subject_attendance` (line 559) | Updates append a new event; tracks `attendance_type` / `notes` / `notify` changes | real | Change tracking at `services.rs:571-587`; `no changes` rejection at `services.rs:589-592`; version bump at `services.rs:595`; `SubjectAttendanceUpdated` event at `services.rs:596-603`. |
| `mark_staff_attendance` (line 621) | StaffAttendance unique by `(school, staff, date)`; staff must be active on the date; `OnLeave` is distinct from `Absent` | partial | Uniqueness via `uniqueness.staff_day_exists` at `services.rs:635-639`; notes via `validate_notes` at `services.rs:631-633`. **Missing:** invariant 2 (active-roster check on date). |
| `update_staff_attendance` (line 681) | Updates append a new event; tracks `attendance_type` / `notes` changes | real | Change tracking at `services.rs:693-702`; `no changes` rejection at `services.rs:704-707`; version bump at `services.rs:710`; `StaffAttendanceUpdated` event at `services.rs:711-718`. |
| `mark_exam_attendance` (line 737) | ExamAttendance is owned by the assessment domain per spec (`docs/specs/attendance/aggregates.md:88`); uniqueness on `(exam, student, subject, date)` | partial | Aggregate construction at `services.rs:752-771`; event at `services.rs:772-783`. **Missing:** the `_uniqueness` parameter is ignored (`services.rs:741,749`); no future-date check; cross-domain ownership violation — function lives in `crates/domains/attendance/` but creates the assessment-owned `ExamAttendance` aggregate. |
| `update_exam_attendance` (line 798) | Updates append a new event; tracks `attendance_type` / `notes` changes | real | Change tracking at `services.rs:810-819`; `no changes` rejection at `services.rs:821-824`; version bump at `services.rs:827`; `ExamAttendanceUpdated` event at `services.rs:828-835`. |
| `import_attendance` (line 855) | BulkAttendanceImport idempotent on `(school_id, source, attendance_date)`; staging rows validated; one school, one academic year | partial | Idempotency via `uniqueness.import_source_date_exists` at `services.rs:887-893`; per-row notes validation at `services.rs:878-882`; staging rows constructed at `services.rs:906-922`. **Missing:** cross-row date uniqueness is deferred to dispatcher (`services.rs:884-886` comment); no per-row enrollment validation; no future-date check. |
| `validate_bulk_import` (line 962) | Status transitions `Pending -> Validated` or `Pending -> Failed`; failed rows do not produce attendance | real | Per-row well-formed check at `services.rs:984-992`; absent/failed counting at `services.rs:986-993`; status transition to `Validated` or `Failed` at `services.rs:996-1015`; either `Validated` or `Failed` event returned via `EitherImportEvent` (`services.rs:973-982`). |
| `commit_bulk_import` (line 1043) | `Validated -> Committed`; each validated row promotes to a `StudentAttendance` with real `student_record_id`, `class_id`, `section_id` resolved from enrollment | stub | Status guard at `services.rs:1067-1071`. **Self-documented Phase 5 stub:** "The staging row doesn't carry a `student_record_id` (Phase 5 stub); the dispatcher resolves it from the enrollment table on commit" at `services.rs:1098-1101`; same for `class_id` / `section_id` at `services.rs:1108-1113`. The promoted aggregate uses `event_id_to_uuid(event_id)` as the synthetic id for all three fields (`services.rs:1102-1113`). |
| `cancel_bulk_import` (line 1148) | Bulk import is cancellable only from a non-terminal state | real | Terminal-state guard at `services.rs:1163-1167`; status transition to `Cancelled` at `services.rs:1169`; `BulkImportCancelled` event at `services.rs:1173-1180`. |
| `request_absence_notification` (line 1190) | Emits `AbsenceNotificationRequested` for the resolved `(student_id, attendance_date)` of a `StudentAttendance` row | stub | Self-documented Phase 5 stub: "the Phase 5 stub carries the Unix epoch as a placeholder" for `attendance_date` at `services.rs:1203-1208`; placeholder `StudentId` at `services.rs:1213-1215`. Real values are deferred to the dispatcher. |
| `AttendanceService::is_late` (line 1242) | Late-arrival detection considering the school's `late_threshold_minutes` setting and day-of-week calendar | stub | Self-documented Phase 5 stub: "The full implementation considers the school's `late_threshold_minutes` setting and the day-of-week calendar. The integration test (Workstream D) exercises the production path" at `services.rs:1247-1252`. Function body returns `false` unconditionally. |
| `AttendanceService::emit_absence_event` (line 1259) | Mint `StudentAbsentForDay` from a `StudentAttendance` row iff the row is absent and carries a `last_event_id` | real | Absent-row guard at `services.rs:1262`; `last_event_id` invariant check at `services.rs:1273-1276` (comment notes the prior `unwrap_or_else` was removed to surface the invariant violation); `StudentAbsentForDay::new` at `services.rs:1277-1285`. |
| `AttendanceService::dedup_within_day` (line 1293) | Dedup `StudentAbsentForDay` events by `(student_id, attendance_date)`, first-wins | real | `HashSet<(Uuid, NaiveDate)>` dedup at `services.rs:1296-1304`; preserves input order via `Vec` accumulation. |

### Summary

- **Total pub fn:** 17
- **Real:** 8 (`update_student_attendance`, `update_subject_attendance`, `update_staff_attendance`, `update_exam_attendance`, `validate_bulk_import`, `cancel_bulk_import`, `emit_absence_event`, `dedup_within_day`)
- **Partial:** 5 (`mark_student_attendance`, `mark_subject_attendance`, `mark_staff_attendance`, `mark_exam_attendance`, `import_attendance`) — each implements its primary uniqueness invariant but is missing cross-aggregate lookups (class-section match, subject assignment, active-roster), future-date validation, or RBAC checks the spec requires.
- **Stub:** 4 (`bulk_mark_student_attendance`, `commit_bulk_import`, `request_absence_notification`, `is_late`) — each carries self-documented "Phase 5 stub" placeholders that defer real value resolution to the dispatcher.

## academic

**Crate:** `crates/domains/academic/src/services.rs`
**Spec reference:** `docs/specs/academic/aggregates.md`
**Function count:** 37 (`pub fn` + `pub async fn` only; excludes the `school_matches` helper at services.rs:1223 and the private `fresh_event_id`)
**Stub count:** 14 (the placeholder skeletons block at services.rs:1231-1244, services.rs:1246-1624)

Phase 3 ships the prompt-named subset (Student lifecycle, Class, Section,
Subject, AcademicYear) as real or partial; the remaining 14 aggregates have
placeholder skeletons that validate only the tenant anchor and emit empty
events. Per the in-file comment block at services.rs:1231-1244, the full impl
for those 14 is deferred to subsequent workstreams per `docs/build-plan.md`.

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `admit_student` (services.rs:102) | Student invariants 2 (admission_no unique within school), 5 (status transitions from Applicant) | real | services.rs:131-139 — calls `validate_admission_no`, `validate_first_name`, `validate_last_name`, optional `validate_email_optional`, optional `validate_roll_no`; services.rs:141-144 — admission_no uniqueness via `UniquenessChecker::student_admission_no_exists`; services.rs:146-152 — email uniqueness; services.rs:154-180 — builds aggregate via `Student::fresh`. Note: admission_no uniqueness is school-scoped (per spec invariant 2). Roll_no uniqueness (invariant 3 — unique within `(class, section, academic_year)`) requires a storage query and is not enforced here. |
| `update_student_profile` (services.rs:217) | Student invariants (no specific invariants; mutates profile fields, preserves status) | real | services.rs:243-301 — per-field validation (`validate_first_name`, `validate_last_name`, `validate_mobile_optional`, `validate_email_optional`) and email uniqueness check (services.rs:283-294) using `UniquenessChecker`. No status transition involved; purely profile mutation. |
| `suspend_student` (services.rs:331) | Student invariant 5 (`Active → Suspended` only) | partial | services.rs:346 — calls `validate_suspension_reason`; services.rs:348-353 — sets `student.status = StudentStatus::Suspended`. **Gap:** does not check the precondition that the student is currently `Active` (invariant 5); suspending an already-Suspended/Withdrawn/Graduated student would silently overwrite its status. |
| `reinstate_student` (services.rs:371) | Student invariant 5 (`Suspended → Active`) | real | services.rs:382-386 — explicit check `if student.status != StudentStatus::Suspended` returns `Conflict`; services.rs:388 — sets `Active`. Correctly enforces the back-edge of invariant 5. |
| `withdraw_student` (services.rs:415) | Student invariants 5 (`Active → Withdrawn`), 6 (no active `StudentRecord` after withdrawal) | partial | services.rs:431 — `validate_withdrawal_reason`; services.rs:433-439 — sets `Withdrawn` + `Retired`. **Gap:** does not check precondition that student is `Active` (could be silently invoked on already-Withdrawn); invariant 6 (clearing the active `StudentRecord`) is not enforced here because `StudentRecord` is a separate aggregate handled in a later phase. |
| `transfer_student` (services.rs:457) | Student invariant 5 (`Active → Transferred`) | real | services.rs:476-480 — `validate_transfer_reason`; services.rs:481-485 — validates `destination_school_id != student.school_id` (cross-school invariant); services.rs:487-492 — sets `Transferred` + `Retired`. **Gap (acknowledged):** precondition that student is currently `Active` is not enforced. |
| `promote_student` (services.rs:510) | Student invariant 5 (`AcademicYear` sub-clause: `From`/`To` years must be same school, `To` must be next sequential year); `StudentRecord` invariants 1, 4 | partial | services.rs:530-534 — checks `from_academic_year_id != to_academic_year_id`. Per the docstring (services.rs:507-509), the function explicitly does **not** mutate `class_id`/`section_id` fields (those live on `StudentRecord`, deferred). **Gap:** does not validate (a) both years are in the same school as the student, (b) `To` is the next sequential year, or (c) the student currently has a `StudentRecord` to close. Invariant enforcement delegated to subscribers / later phase. |
| `graduate_student` (services.rs:558) | Student invariant 5 (`Active → Graduated`); `StudentRecord` invariant 5 (`IsGraduate=true`) | partial | services.rs:574-578 — sets `Graduated` + `Retired`. **Gap:** does not validate that the student is in a graduating year; does not mark any `StudentRecord` as `IsGraduate` (handled via subscribers or later phase). |
| `create_class` (services.rs:599) | Class invariants 1 (belongs to one school — implicit via id), 2 (unique name within school) | partial | services.rs:614-616 — `validate_class_name`, `validate_pass_mark`; services.rs:617-625 — builds via `Class::fresh`. **Gap:** invariant 2 (class name uniqueness within school) is not enforced via `UniquenessChecker`; the trait in `commands.rs` does not expose a class-name method. |
| `update_class` (services.rs:641) | Class invariant 2 (unique name within school) | partial | services.rs:660-672 — per-field validation; services.rs:674-676 — updates aggregate. **Gap:** no uniqueness check on class_name change (same as `create_class`). |
| `set_optional_subject_gpa_threshold` (services.rs:698) | Class invariant 3 (`OptionalSubjectGpaThreshold` configured) | real | services.rs:712 — `validate_gpa_threshold`; services.rs:713-717 — sets `OptionalSubjectGpaThreshold` value object and updates aggregate. Single-purpose, fully implemented. |
| `delete_class` (services.rs:733) | Class invariant 4 (cannot delete if any `ClassSection` references it) | partial | services.rs:749-755 — soft-delete via `active_status = Retired`. **Gap:** invariant 4 (referential check against `ClassSection` rows) is not enforced; the `UniquenessChecker`/`ReferentialChecker` surface does not expose a `class_has_class_sections` method, and the function does no `Refused` check. |
| `create_section` (services.rs:764) | Section invariant 1 (unique name within school) | partial | services.rs:779 — `validate_section_name`; services.rs:780-787 — builds via `Section::fresh`. **Gap:** no uniqueness check on `section_name` within school. |
| `update_section` (services.rs:796) | Section invariant 1 | partial | services.rs:812-818 — validates name change; services.rs:820-822 — updates aggregate. **Gap:** no uniqueness check on rename. |
| `delete_section` (services.rs:842) | Section invariant 3 (soft-deletable; existing refs remain) | real | services.rs:857-863 — soft-delete via `active_status = Retired`. Spec explicitly allows soft-delete with refs intact; behavior matches. |
| `create_subject` (services.rs:873) | Subject invariants 1 (unique code within school), 2 (`SubjectType` enum), 3 (configurable pass mark) | partial | services.rs:895-897 — `validate_subject_code`, `validate_subject_name`, `validate_pass_mark`; services.rs:898-909 — builds via `Subject::fresh` with `subject_type` and `pass_mark`. **Gap:** invariant 1 (code uniqueness within school) is not enforced — no `subject_code_exists` on `UniquenessChecker`. |
| `update_subject` (services.rs:922) | Subject invariants 2, 3 | real | services.rs:942-964 — per-field validation; services.rs:966-968 — updates aggregate. Spec invariant 1 is about creation-time code uniqueness; update does not change code, so no uniqueness re-check needed. |
| `delete_subject` (services.rs:989) | Subject invariants (no specific delete rule) | real | services.rs:1004-1010 — soft-delete. No spec invariant forbids this; behavior matches. |
| `create_academic_year` (services.rs:1020) | `AcademicYear` invariants 1 (start < end), 2 (no overlap), 3 (exactly one current) | partial | services.rs:1047-1050 — `validate_year_label`, `validate_year_title`; services.rs:1051 — `AcademicYearRange::new` enforces start < end (invariant 1); services.rs:1052-1060 — builds via `AcademicYear::fresh`; services.rs:1060 — sets `is_current = is_current`. **Gap:** invariants 2 (no overlap with other years) and 3 (exactly one current) are **not** checked — the docstring on `set_current_academic_year` (services.rs:1095-1097) and the in-file comment acknowledge these as storage-adapter responsibilities. |
| `update_academic_year_dates` (services.rs:1074) | `AcademicYear` invariant 2 (no overlap) | partial | services.rs:1092 — `AcademicYearRange::new` (invariant 1 OK). **Gap:** invariant 2 (no overlap with other years) is not checked. |
| `set_current_academic_year` (services.rs:1113) | `AcademicYear` invariant 3 (exactly one current) | partial | services.rs:1131-1135 — checks `is_closed` and rejects; services.rs:1137-1138 — sets `is_current = true`. **Gap (delegated):** invariant 3 (exactly one current per school) requires demoting the previously-current year; the docstring (services.rs:1095-1097) explicitly delegates this to the storage adapter. The service emits the event; the adapter cascades. |
| `close_academic_year` (services.rs:1151) | `AcademicYear` invariant 4 (non-current may be opened for read-only queries — by extension, closing makes it read-only) | real | services.rs:1167-1173 — sets `is_closed = true`; demotes `is_current = false` if currently current. |
| `copy_academic_year` (services.rs:1186) | `AcademicYear` invariants (no specific copy rules; same-school implicit) | real (event emission); deep-copy delegated to storage | services.rs:1198-1202 — validates `from.school_id() == year_agg.school_id` (same school); services.rs:1203-1206 — validates `from != year_agg.id`. Per docstring (services.rs:1178-1183), the actual deep copy of classes/sections/subjects is a storage-side concern; the function emits the marker event. |
| `register_guardian` (services.rs:1246) | Guardian invariants 1 (at most one phone, one email), 2 (multi-student), 3 (Relation + IsPrimary), 4 (at most one IsPrimary per student), 5 (soft-delete when all links removed) | stub | services.rs:1248-1261 — only checks `id.school_id() == school_id` (tenant anchor); constructs `Guardian { id, school_id }`; emits empty `GuardianRegistered` event with no payload fields. **All 5 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_class_section` (services.rs:1275) | `ClassSection` invariants 1 (unique per `(class, section, academic_year)`), 2 (multiple teachers), 3 (one or more class rooms), 4 (cannot delete while `StudentRecord` refs exist) | stub | services.rs:1277-1289 — tenant-anchor check + empty `ClassSection` aggregate + empty `ClassSectionCreated` event. **All 4 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_class_subject` (services.rs:1305) | `ClassSubject` invariants 1 (class or class-section scope), 2 (one teacher per assignment), 3 (PassMark override) | stub | services.rs:1307-1318 — tenant-anchor only. **All 3 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_class_routine` (services.rs:1334) | `ClassRoutine` invariants 1 (covers a full week), 2 (`ClassTime` periods), 3 (room+teacher per period), 4 (teacher no double-booking), 5 (room no double-booking) | stub | services.rs:1336-1348 — tenant-anchor only. **All 5 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_homework` (services.rs:1363) | Homework invariants 1 (teacher-created, class-section scope), 2 (submission > homework date), 3 (evaluation >= submission date), 4 (optional attachment), 5 (marks immutable once evaluated) | stub | services.rs:1365-1377 — tenant-anchor only. **All 5 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_lesson_plan` (services.rs:1392) | LessonPlan invariants 1 (anchored to Lesson+topic+class-section+subject+date), 2 (sub-topics), 3 (`CompletedStatus`), 4 (one teacher per occurrence) | stub | services.rs:1394-1406 — tenant-anchor only. **All 4 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_lesson` (services.rs:1421) | Lesson invariants 1 (unique title within class-section-subject), 2 (zero or more topics), 3 (creation user + timestamp) | stub | services.rs:1423-1435 — tenant-anchor only. **All 3 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_lesson_topic` (services.rs:1450) | LessonTopic invariants 1 (belongs to one lesson), 2 (`CompletedStatus` + `CompletedDate`) | stub | services.rs:1452-1464 — tenant-anchor only. **Both invariants missing.** |
| `record_student_promotion` (services.rs:1479) | StudentPromotion invariants 1 (references both `From` and `To` `StudentRecord`s), 2 (`ResultStatus` ∈ Pass/Fail/Manual), 3 (immutable) | stub | services.rs:1481-1493 — tenant-anchor only. **All 3 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_student_category` (services.rs:1508) | StudentCategory invariant 1 (unique name within school) | stub | services.rs:1510-1522 — tenant-anchor only. **Invariant 1 missing.** |
| `create_student_group` (services.rs:1537) | StudentGroup invariants 1 (unique name within school), 2 (student can be in many groups) | stub | services.rs:1539-1551 — tenant-anchor only. **Both invariants missing.** |
| `create_registration_field` (services.rs:1566) | RegistrationField invariants 1 (FieldName + LabelName + Type), 2 (IsRequired/IsVisible + editability), 3 (AdminSection) | stub | services.rs:1568-1580 — tenant-anchor only. **All 3 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_certificate` (services.rs:1595) | Certificate invariants 1 (layout + body + footer labels + photo flag), 2 (optional PDF/image attachment), 3 (`DefaultFor` flag) | stub | services.rs:1597-1609 — tenant-anchor only. **All 3 spec invariants missing.** |
| `create_id_card` (services.rs:1624) | IdCard invariants 1 (boolean display flags), 2 (layout dimensions + spacing) | stub | services.rs:1626-1638 — tenant-anchor only. **Both invariants missing.** |

### Summary

- **Total pub fn:** 37
- **Real:** 11 (`admit_student`, `update_student_profile`, `reinstate_student`, `transfer_student`, `set_optional_subject_gpa_threshold`, `delete_section`, `update_subject`, `delete_subject`, `close_academic_year`, `copy_academic_year`, plus the unconditional `set_current_academic_year` ack-delegates the cross-year cascade to storage and is classified real for the single-aggregate invariant it owns)
- **Partial:** 12 (`suspend_student`, `withdraw_student`, `promote_student`, `graduate_student`, `create_class`, `update_class`, `delete_class`, `create_section`, `update_section`, `create_subject`, `create_academic_year`, `update_academic_year_dates`) — each implements its primary single-aggregate invariant but is missing either the precondition guard (status transition), the storage-layer uniqueness check (class/section/subject name), or the cross-year overlap check the spec requires.
- **Stub:** 14 (`register_guardian`, `create_class_section`, `create_class_subject`, `create_class_routine`, `create_homework`, `create_lesson_plan`, `create_lesson`, `create_lesson_topic`, `record_student_promotion`, `create_student_category`, `create_student_group`, `create_registration_field`, `create_certificate`, `create_id_card`) — each is a placeholder skeleton that validates only the tenant anchor and emits an empty event; no domain fields populated.

### Classification rationale

- **Partial vs real** for the prompt-named subset hinges on whether the spec
  invariant requires cross-aggregate or storage-layer state to validate
  (e.g. `(class, section, academic_year)` roll uniqueness, year overlap,
  "exactly one current"). These are intentionally delegated to the storage
  adapter per the service-layer docstrings; the gap is acknowledged, not
  hidden, so they are classified as `partial`.
- **Partial vs real** for transitions (`suspend_student`, `withdraw_student`,
  `promote_student`, `graduate_student`) hinges on whether the function
  enforces the *precondition* (e.g. "must currently be `Active`"). The
  transition itself is set correctly; the precondition guard is missing or
  only partially enforced (`reinstate_student` and `transfer_student` are
  the only ones with explicit precondition checks beyond `is_closed`).
- **Stub** functions in the placeholder section are unambiguously stubs:
  they validate the tenant anchor, build an aggregate literal with only
  `id` and `school_id`, and emit an event with no payload fields. None of
  the spec invariants listed in the column are touched.

## academic — Deep Invariant Audit

**Generated:** Phase 1 Step 2, Engine Production Readiness ferment
**Scope:** Every invariant listed in `docs/specs/academic/aggregates.md`
across all 20 academic aggregates (Student, Guardian, Class, Section,
ClassSection, Subject, ClassSubject, AcademicYear, ClassRoutine,
Homework, LessonPlan, Lesson, LessonTopic, StudentRecord,
StudentPromotion, StudentCategory, StudentGroup, RegistrationField,
Certificate, IdCard).
**Methodology:** For each spec invariant, verify whether the engine
enforces it in either the aggregate constructor (`aggregate.rs`), the
value object (`value_objects.rs`), or the service function
(`services.rs`). Classify as:
- **enforced** — the invariant is validated at the constructor or
  service boundary, with a test or assertion visible in the codebase.
- **partial** — the invariant is partially checked (e.g. transition is
  set correctly but the precondition is missing) or delegated to a
  downstream layer that is acknowledged in source comments.
- **missing** — no enforcement at the constructor, value object, or
  service boundary; placeholder aggregate has only `id + school_id`.
- **permissive (N/A)** — the invariant is a permissive statement
  ("may", "can be reused"); no enforcement is required by the engine.

### Totals

| Status | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Enforced | 8 | 11.0% |
| Partial | 2 | 2.7% |
| Missing | 61 | 83.6% |
| Permissive (N/A) | 2 | 2.7% |
| **Total invariants** | **73** | **100%** |

**Key findings:**
- **14 of 20 aggregates are placeholder stubs** (Guardian, ClassSection,
  ClassSubject, ClassRoutine, Homework, LessonPlan, Lesson, LessonTopic,
  StudentRecord, StudentPromotion, StudentCategory, StudentGroup,
  RegistrationField, Certificate, IdCard). Each placeholder contributes
  every listed invariant as `missing`.
- **The five prompt-named aggregates** (Student, Class, Section, Subject,
  AcademicYear) account for **21 of 73 invariants** (29%) and **all 8
  enforced + 2 partial** invariants.
- **Student invariant #5** (status-transition graph) is the only
  `partial` for the prompt subset — `StudentStatus` is well-typed but
  `suspend_student`, `withdraw_student`, `promote_student`,
  `graduate_student` do not enforce the precondition that the student
  is currently `Active` (only `reinstate_student` does).
- **UniquenessChecker gaps:** the trait at `crates/domains/academic/src/commands.rs:50`
  exposes `student_admission_no_exists` and `student_email_exists`
  only. It has no `class_name_exists`, `section_name_exists`, or
  `subject_code_exists` method, which is why invariant 2 of `Class`,
  invariant 1 of `Section`, and invariant 1 of `Subject` are missing
  enforcement at the service boundary.
- **StudentRecord** has the most missing invariants (6 of 6) — the
  aggregate is `pub struct StudentRecord { id, school_id }` at
  `aggregate.rs:445`, with no fields for `class_id`, `section_id`,
  `academic_year_id`, `roll_no`, `is_default`, `is_promote`,
  `is_graduate`, or `admission_no`. Per `value_objects.rs:186` this is
  documented as Phase 4 deferred (downstream assessment domain needs
  the typed id).
- **No cross-aggregate referential checks** — invariants that require
  looking up another row (e.g. ClassSection referencing StudentRecord,
  Class referencing ClassSection for the delete guard) have no
  `ReferentialChecker` exposed on any academic service command.

### Per-aggregate invariant table

| Aggregate | # | Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Student | 1 | Exactly one active `StudentRecord` per `AcademicYear` | Per-student, per-year enrollment uniqueness | missing | `StudentRecord` aggregate is `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:445` — no fields, no service factory, no repository check. `value_objects.rs:186` doc acknowledges Phase 4 deferral. |
| Student | 2 | `AdmissionNumber` unique within school | Tenant-scoped admission number uniqueness | enforced | `commands.rs:55-57` — `UniquenessChecker::student_admission_no_exists(school, admission_no)` is called in `services.rs:141-144` (admit_student); `value_objects.rs:299-302` enforces 1..=50 chars at the `AdmissionNumber::new` constructor. |
| Student | 3 | `RollNumber` unique within `(school, class, section, academic_year)` | Composite-key roll uniqueness | missing | `UniquenessChecker` trait at `commands.rs:50` has no `roll_no_exists(school, class, section, year)` method. `services.rs:102-180` (admit_student) accepts a `roll_no` parameter but performs no storage query against the composite key. `RollNumber::new` (`value_objects.rs:341-345`) validates 1..=50 chars but not uniqueness. |
| Student | 4 | At most one optional subject per academic year | Cap on optional-subject assignments | missing | `OptionalSubjectAssignment` aggregate does not exist; the only `Option<>` in `Student` (`aggregate.rs:114-138`) is `custom_fields`, `blood_group`, etc. — no optional-subject field on the aggregate. |
| Student | 5 | Status transitions `Applicant → Active → {Suspended, Withdrawn, Graduated, Transferred}` | FSM with 6 states, 5 transitions | partial | `StudentStatus` enum at `value_objects.rs:573-590` defines all 6 states and `is_terminal()`; `reinstate_student` (`services.rs:382-386`) explicitly checks `status != Suspended` and rejects. **Missing:** `suspend_student` (`services.rs:346-353`), `withdraw_student` (`services.rs:433-439`), `transfer_student` (`services.rs:487-492`), `graduate_student` (`services.rs:574-578`) all overwrite `student.status` without checking the precondition that the current state is `Active`. |
| Student | 6 | Withdrawn/Graduated student has no active `StudentRecord` | Cross-aggregate cascade on terminal status | missing | `StudentRecord` aggregate is a placeholder (see invariant #1); no service factory cascades the `student.status = Withdrawn/Graduated` change to clear or retire the corresponding `StudentRecord` row. |
| Guardian | 1 | At most one phone and one email of record | One-of-each contact invariant | missing | `Guardian` is a placeholder struct `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:325-329`; `register_guardian` (`services.rs:1246-1261`) only checks `id.school_id() == school_id` and emits an empty event. |
| Guardian | 2 | Multi-student linkage | Many-to-many student-guardian | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `StudentGuardianLink` child aggregate defined. |
| Guardian | 3 | `Relation` + `IsPrimary` per link | Link attributes | missing | Same as #1 — no `Relation` enum (Father/Mother/Guardian/Other), no `IsPrimary` field. |
| Guardian | 4 | At most one `IsPrimary` per student | Per-student primary uniqueness | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| Guardian | 5 | Soft-delete when all student links removed | Cascade soft-delete | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no link-tracking structure. |
| Class | 1 | Belongs to exactly one school | Tenant anchor | enforced | `Class.id: ClassId` is the typed id `ClassId { school_id, value }` (`value_objects.rs:73-77`); `Class::fresh` (`aggregate.rs:213-235`) sets `school_id: id.school_id()`. The `Class` struct cannot exist without the school anchor being set in the type system. |
| Class | 2 | Unique name within school | Tenant-scoped name uniqueness | missing | `UniquenessChecker` trait (`commands.rs:50-57`) has no `class_name_exists(school, name)` method. `create_class` (`services.rs:599-625`) calls `validate_class_name` for 1..=200 chars (`value_objects.rs:407-413`) but performs no uniqueness query. `update_class` (`services.rs:660-672`) is the same shape. |
| Class | 3 | `OptionalSubjectGpaThreshold` configurable | Value object 0.0..=5.0 | enforced | `OptionalSubjectGpaThreshold::new` (`value_objects.rs:778-786`) validates 0.0..=5.0; `set_optional_subject_gpa_threshold` (`services.rs:698-720`) calls `validate_gpa_threshold` then sets `optional_subject_gpa_threshold` on the aggregate. Single-purpose, fully implemented. |
| Class | 4 | Cannot delete if any `ClassSection` references it | Referential delete guard | missing | `delete_class` (`services.rs:733-758`) soft-deletes via `active_status = Retired` without checking the `ClassSection` table. No `ReferentialChecker` surface is exposed on the academic service commands. |
| Section | 1 | Unique name within school | Tenant-scoped name uniqueness | missing | Same gap as `Class` #2 — `UniquenessChecker` trait has no `section_name_exists(school, name)`. `create_section` (`services.rs:764-787`) validates 1..=200 chars but not uniqueness; `update_section` (`services.rs:796-822`) the same. |
| Section | 2 | Reusable across multiple `AcademicYear`s | Permissive cross-year reuse | permissive (N/A) | Data model permits: `Section` has no `academic_year_id` field (`aggregate.rs:255-280`), so the same `SectionId` can be referenced by any number of `ClassSection` rows across years. No enforcement is required; this is a statement of model freedom. |
| Section | 3 | Soft-deletable; existing references remain | Soft-delete semantics | enforced | `delete_section` (`services.rs:842-866`) sets `active_status = Retired` rather than hard-deleting; spec explicitly allows soft-delete with references intact. `Section.is_active()` is preserved for soft-delete filtering. |
| ClassSection | 1 | Unique per `(class, section, academic_year)` | Composite-key uniqueness | missing | `ClassSection` is a placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:330-333`. `create_class_section` (`services.rs:1275-1289`) only validates the tenant anchor. |
| ClassSection | 2 | Multiple class teachers and subject teachers | Permissive fan-out | permissive (N/A) | Data model permits: the placeholder leaves room for `Vec<ClassTeacher>` / `Vec<SubjectTeacher>` children, but no constraint forbids fan-out — this is a permissive statement, not requiring enforcement. |
| ClassSection | 3 | One or more class rooms | At-least-one cardinality | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `ClassRoom` field or collection. |
| ClassSection | 4 | Cannot delete while `StudentRecord` refs exist | Referential delete guard | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no service factory, no referential check. |
| Subject | 1 | Unique code within school | Tenant-scoped code uniqueness | missing | `UniquenessChecker` trait (`commands.rs:50-57`) has no `subject_code_exists(school, code)`. `create_subject` (`services.rs:873-909`) validates 1..=50 chars (`value_objects.rs:362-369`) and constructs `Subject::fresh` but performs no uniqueness query. |
| Subject | 2 | `SubjectType` is `Theory` or `Practical` | Closed enum | enforced | `SubjectType` enum at `value_objects.rs:689-697` has exactly two variants; `Subject::fresh` (`aggregate.rs:331-353`) takes a `subject_type: SubjectType` parameter so the type system rejects any other value at compile time. |
| Subject | 3 | Configurable pass mark | Value object 0.0..=100.0 | enforced | `PassMark::new` (`value_objects.rs:753-762`) validates 0.0..=100.0; `create_subject` and `update_subject` both call `validate_pass_mark`. |
| ClassSubject | 1 | Class or class-section scope | Aggregate scope flexibility | missing | `ClassSubject` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:335-338`; no `class_id` / `class_section_id` field, no scope selector. |
| ClassSubject | 2 | Same teacher may be assigned to multiple class-subjects | Permissive fan-out | permissive (N/A) | Same shape as `ClassSection` #2 — data model permits; no enforcement needed. |
| ClassSubject | 3 | `PassMark` override | Per-assignment pass mark | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `pass_mark` field on the aggregate. |
| AcademicYear | 1 | Start date strictly before end date | Range ordering | enforced | `AcademicYearRange::new` (`value_objects.rs:683-694`) rejects `start >= end` with `DomainError::validation`; `create_academic_year` (`services.rs:1020-1071`) calls `AcademicYearRange::new` before constructing the aggregate. |
| AcademicYear | 2 | No overlap within school | Cross-row disjointness | missing | `update_academic_year_dates` (`services.rs:1074-1099`) accepts a new `AcademicYearRange` without checking it against other `AcademicYear` rows for the school. `UniquenessChecker` has no `academic_year_overlaps(school, range)` method. |
| AcademicYear | 3 | Exactly one current per school | Per-school current-year uniqueness | partial | `set_current_academic_year` (`services.rs:1113-1145`) checks `is_closed` and sets `is_current = true` on the target row but does **not** demote the previously-current row. The doc-comment at `services.rs:1095-1097` explicitly delegates the cross-row cascade to the storage adapter. Per `aggregate.rs:402-403`, `AcademicYear.is_current: bool` is a single-row flag — there is no school-scoped constraint at the constructor. |
| AcademicYear | 4 | Non-current may be opened for read-only queries | Read-only flag | enforced | `AcademicYear.is_closed: bool` (`aggregate.rs:412-413`); `close_academic_year` (`services.rs:1151-1184`) sets `is_closed = true` and demotes `is_current = false` if currently current; `set_current_academic_year` rejects with `is_closed` guard at `services.rs:1131-1135`. |
| AcademicYear | 5 | Promote requires same-school `From`/`To`; `To` next sequential | Cross-year sequencing | missing | `promote_student` (`services.rs:510-555`) only checks `from_academic_year_id != to_academic_year_id`; does not validate (a) same-school membership, (b) sequential ordering, (c) `To` year is the immediate successor. The doc-comment at `services.rs:507-509` explicitly defers `StudentRecord` mutation. |
| ClassRoutine | 1 | Covers a full week | 7-day span invariant | missing | `ClassRoutine` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:340-343`; no `periods` / `ClassTime` collection. |
| ClassRoutine | 2 | `ClassTime` periods | Period identification | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| ClassRoutine | 3 | Room + teacher per period per day | Per-slot assignment | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| ClassRoutine | 4 | Teacher cannot be in two places at the same time | Cross-row teacher conflict | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `ReferentialChecker` surface. |
| ClassRoutine | 5 | Room cannot host two classes at the same time | Cross-row room conflict | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `ReferentialChecker` surface. |
| Homework | 1 | Teacher-created, class-section scope | Creation context | missing | `Homework` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:345-348`; no `created_by`, `class_section_id` fields. |
| Homework | 2 | Submission date after homework date | Date ordering | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| Homework | 3 | Evaluation date >= submission date | Date ordering | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| Homework | 4 | Optional attachment | Attachment field | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `attachment` field. |
| Homework | 5 | Marks immutable once evaluated | Immutability after evaluation | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `evaluated_at` / `marks` field. |
| LessonPlan | 1 | Anchored to Lesson+topic+class-section+subject+date | Aggregate anchor | missing | `LessonPlan` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:351-354`; no anchor fields. |
| LessonPlan | 2 | Sub-topics | Sub-collection | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| LessonPlan | 3 | `CompletedStatus` enum | Lifecycle status | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `CompletedStatus` enum (the spec lists Pending/InProgress/Completed/Skipped but no such enum is defined in `value_objects.rs`). |
| LessonPlan | 4 | Multiple teachers share templates; one teacher per occurrence | Ownership rule | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| Lesson | 1 | Unique title within `(class-section, subject)` | Composite-key title uniqueness | missing | `Lesson` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:357-360`; no `title` / `class_section_id` / `subject_id` fields, no uniqueness check. |
| Lesson | 2 | Zero or more topics | Topic collection | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `topics` collection. |
| Lesson | 3 | Creation user + timestamp | Audit metadata | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `created_by` / `created_at` fields (the `Student` / `Class` / `Section` / `Subject` aggregates carry these, but `Lesson` does not). |
| LessonTopic | 1 | Belongs to one lesson | Single-parent link | missing | `LessonTopic` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:363-366`; no `lesson_id` field. |
| LessonTopic | 2 | `CompletedStatus` + `CompletedDate` | Lifecycle fields | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `CompletedStatus` enum, no `CompletedDate` field. |
| StudentRecord | 1 | At most one non-graduate, non-withdrawn per academic year | Per-year enrollment cardinality | missing | `StudentRecord` is `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:445-449`; no `class_id`, `section_id`, `academic_year_id`, `is_graduate`, `is_withdrawn` fields. `value_objects.rs:186-192` doc acknowledges Phase 4 deferral — typed id added for downstream assessment dependency but aggregate structure not built. |
| StudentRecord | 2 | `RollNumber` unique within `(class, section, academic_year)` | Composite-key uniqueness | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `roll_no` field. |
| StudentRecord | 3 | `IsDefault` per student | Default-record marker | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `is_default` field. |
| StudentRecord | 4 | `IsPromote=false` until `StudentPromoted` | Promotion lifecycle flag | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `is_promote` field. |
| StudentRecord | 5 | `IsGraduate=true` when graduate | Graduation flag | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `is_graduate` field. |
| StudentRecord | 6 | `AdmissionNumber` carried over; new on promotion | Admission-number lineage | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `admission_no` field. |
| StudentPromotion | 1 | References both `From` and `To` `StudentRecord`s | Cross-record reference | missing | `StudentPromotion` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:369-372`; no `from_record_id` / `to_record_id` fields. |
| StudentPromotion | 2 | `ResultStatus` is `Pass` / `Fail` / `Manual` | Closed enum | missing | `ResultStatus` enum is defined at `value_objects.rs:710-720` (Pass/Fail/Manual), but `StudentPromotion` placeholder does not carry a `result_status` field. |
| StudentPromotion | 3 | Immutable once written | Append-only | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `created_at` to anchor immutability, no service factory to assert it. |
| StudentCategory | 1 | Unique name within school | Tenant-scoped name uniqueness | missing | `StudentCategory` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:375-378`; `create_student_category` (`services.rs:1508-1522`) only validates the tenant anchor. |
| StudentGroup | 1 | Unique name within school | Tenant-scoped name uniqueness | missing | `StudentGroup` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:381-384`; same gap. |
| StudentGroup | 2 | Student can be in many groups | Permissive many-to-many | permissive (N/A) | Data model permits — no constraint forbids a student from being in multiple groups; this is a permissive statement. |
| RegistrationField | 1 | `FieldName` + `LabelName` + `Type` | Triple-attribute | missing | `RegistrationField` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:387-390`; no `field_name` / `label_name` / `type` (Student or Staff) fields. |
| RegistrationField | 2 | `IsRequired` / `IsVisible` + editability flags | Boolean configuration | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| RegistrationField | 3 | `AdminSection` | Form-placement | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `admin_section` field. |
| Certificate | 1 | Layout (Portrait/Landscape) + body + footer (up to 3 labels) + photo flag | Template shape | missing | `Certificate` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:393-396`; no `layout` / `body` / `footer_labels` / `photo` fields. |
| Certificate | 2 | Optional attachment (PDF or image) | Attachment field | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| Certificate | 3 | `DefaultFor` flag | Default-marker | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder. |
| IdCard | 1 | Boolean display flags (admission number, name, class, photo, ...) | Template booleans | missing | `IdCard` placeholder `pub struct { id, school_id }` at `aggregate.rs:399-402`; no `display_*` boolean fields. |
| IdCard | 2 | Layout dimensions + spacing | Template geometry | missing | Same as #1 — placeholder; no `width` / `height` / `spacing` fields. |

### Cross-cutting enforcement gaps

1. **`UniquenessChecker` coverage is incomplete.** The trait at
   `commands.rs:50-57` exposes two methods (`student_admission_no_exists`,
   `student_email_exists`). The spec requires at least six additional
   uniqueness checks: `class_name_exists`, `section_name_exists`,
   `subject_code_exists`, `student_category_name_exists`,
   `student_group_name_exists`, `roll_no_exists(school, class, section, year)`.
   None are wired. Phase 2 should expand the trait to cover these.

2. **No `ReferentialChecker` surface exists** in `crates/domains/academic/src/`.
   Cross-aggregate delete guards (Class#4: ClassSection refs Class;
   ClassSection#4: StudentRecord refs ClassSection; ClassRoutine#4/#5:
   teacher/room overlap) cannot be implemented without one. Phase 2
   should introduce a `ReferentialChecker` port trait parallel to
   `UniquenessChecker`.

3. **No transition-precondition enforcement on `Student` aggregates** other
   than `reinstate_student`. The Student aggregate is the only one with
   a defined FSM, and 4 of its 5 transition functions
   (`suspend_student`, `withdraw_student`, `transfer_student`,
   `graduate_student`) silently overwrite `student.status` without
   checking that the current state is `Active`. The `is_terminal()`
   helper on `StudentStatus` (`value_objects.rs:601-604`) is defined
   but unused by any service function. Phase 2 should add explicit
   precondition guards.

4. **`StudentRecord` is a typed-id stub, not an aggregate.** This blocks
   assessment (`StudentRecordId` foreign-key dependency), finance
   (fee assignment per enrollment), attendance (roster resolution),
   and 4 invariants on `Student` (Student#1, Student#4, Student#6,
   AcademicYear#5). Phase 2 or 3 should ship the full `StudentRecord`
   aggregate per the handoff in `value_objects.rs:186-192`.

5. **`AcademicYear` cascade (`is_current` exactly-one)** is delegated
   to the storage adapter with no in-engine helper. The
   `set_current_academic_year` service emits an event but does not
   invalidate the previously-current year. This is a known gap per
   the in-source comment at `services.rs:1095-1097`; Phase 2 should
   add a same-school cascade in the service before the storage
   adapter sees the event.

### Classification rationale

- **Enforced vs partial** hinges on whether the service function (or
  constructor) covers every precondition the invariant requires.
  `StudentStatus::is_terminal()` is defined but `suspend_student` does
  not check `student.status == Active` first — that's a `partial`,
  not `enforced`, because the post-state is correct but the
  precondition is unenforced.
- **Missing vs permissive** hinges on whether the invariant forbids a
  state (e.g. "at most one phone") or permits one (e.g. "may be reused
  across years"). Permissive invariants are classified as `N/A` rather
  than `missing` because the engine is not required to enforce them.
- **Placeholder aggregates** (14 of 20) contribute every listed
  invariant as `missing` because the aggregate struct is
  `pub struct { id, school_id }` with no domain fields, no value
  object, and a service factory that emits an empty event.
- **The two `partial` entries** (Student#5, AcademicYear#3) are
  different in kind: Student#5 is "transition set correctly, source
  precondition missing"; AcademicYear#3 is "single-row flag set,
  cross-row cascade delegated to storage adapter". Both are real
  spec violations that the service function should address before
  the downstream layer can be trusted.

## assessment

**Crate:** `crates/domains/assessment/src/services.rs`
**Function count:** 72
**Stub count:** 35 (`DomainError::not_supported("TODO: ...")` handlers — the task brief estimated 36; the actual enumeration yields 35)
**Real / Partial / Stub:** 12 real / 25 partial / 35 stub

The 72 functions split into six clusters:

- **Workstream A — Exam core (4 fns):** `create_exam`,
  `update_exam`, `delete_exam`, `school_matches`.
- **Workstream B — ExamSchedule / SeatPlan / AdmitCard (9
  fns):** minimal-shape pure factory functions; the module
  comment at services.rs:348 explicitly notes "The full
  validation logic ... lands in a follow-up phase".
- **Workstream C — MarksRegister / ResultStore /
  ReportCard (8 fns):** placeholder-id factory functions;
  module comment at services.rs:610 acknowledges the same.
- **Cluster C handler skeletons (35 async fns):** all
  return `DomainError::not_supported("TODO: ...")` per
  services.rs:1173.
- **ResultService — grading module (10 fns):** the
  table-driven A-F grading pipeline.
- **OnlineExamLifecycleService (5 fns):** the
  `start_exam` / `submit_responses` / `grade_responses` /
  `finalize_results` / `archive_attempt` factory quintet;
  module comment at services.rs:1734 marks them all as
  "Phase 4 Workstream D stub".

|----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| `ResultService::compute_grade` | MarksGrade invariants 3 (contiguous scale) + 4 (one Fail boundary) | partial | services.rs:1449-1472 — table-driven A+/A/B+/B/C/D/E/F mapping (rs:1453-1469) hardcoded; missing: per-school `MarksGrade` scale — module comment rs:1437-1443 acknowledges "the full per-school grade scale ... lands in a follow-up phase" |
| `ResultService::compute_subject_marks` | Per-subject grade for one child row | real | services.rs:1474-1486 — computes percent from `marks/full_mark` and delegates to `compute_grade` (rs:1480-1485) |

| `ResultService::validate_no_overlap` | MarksGrade invariant 3 (non-overlapping percentage range) | partial | services.rs:1557-1567 — delegates to `_scale.validate()` (rs:1563); the function body itself does no validation; relies on the scale port's correctness |

| `OnlineExamLifecycleService::archive_attempt` | StudentTakeOnlineExam retirement (audit-only retention) | partial | services.rs:1905-1931 — emits `OnlineExamDeleted` reusing the deleted-event shape (rs:1925-1929); no actual archive, no audit-log emission |

### Placeholder helpers (impl extension)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| `ResultStoreId::cast_exam_id_placeholder` | Cross-cutting — re-resolve ExamId from storage port | stub | services.rs:1700-1710 — returns `ExamId::new(self.school_id(), uuid::Uuid::nil())`; doc-comment rs:1703-1705 acknowledges "Phase 4 stub. Returns an `ExamId` placeholder. The real resolution lands in Phase 16" |

### Summary

- **35 stub** handlers (the Cluster C block at services.rs:1173-1405)
  cover every command handler for: MarksGrade (3), ExamSetting (3),
  ExamSignature (1), ExamRoutinePage (1), FrontendExamRoutine (1),
  FrontendResult (1), FrontendExamResult (1), OnlineExam (5),
  QuestionBank (3), QuestionGroup (3), QuestionLevel (3),
  AdmitCardSetting (1), TeacherEvaluation (3), TeacherRemark (2),
  CustomResultSetting (1), ExamStepSkip (1), ExamAttendance (2).
  This is one fewer than the brief's estimate of 36; the
  discrepancy is the audit re-count, not a missed function.
- **Workstream B / C / OnlineExam lifecycle** functions
  (services.rs:335-657, 963-1176, 1777-1931) are factories
  that return real domain events but skip the validation logic
  that the spec requires (time-window checks, conflict checks,
  child-row cascades, lifecycle state machines).
- **`ResultService` compute / rank / build / find** functions
  (services.rs:1474-1620) are pure and tested; the
  **`compute_grade`** / **`validate_no_overlap`** /
  **`validate_contiguous`** trio is partial because the
  per-school `MarksGrade` scale is hardcoded to the standard
  A-F table rather than loaded from the school's grade rows.
- **The two Exam core mutators** (`create_exam`, `update_exam`,
  `delete_exam`) plus the cross-cutting `school_matches` helper
  are the only fully-real services in this file.
- **`ResultStoreId::cast_exam_id_placeholder`** (rs:1700-1710)
  is the only non-`pub fn` placement worth calling out: it is
  an impl-block helper that returns a `Uuid::nil()` `ExamId`,
  used by `republish_result` and `generate_report_card`. It is
  marked "Phase 4 stub" in its own doc-comment and will be
  removed when the engine facade re-resolves the metadata via
  the storage port.

| `create_notice` (services.rs:69) | `publish_on >= notice_date` cross-field rule; non-empty title/body | partial | services.rs:84-90 enforces `publish_on >= notice_date`; no audience non-empty check; title/body non-empty enforcement delegated to VO constructors (`NoticeTitle::new`, `NoticeBody::new`). |
| `update_notice` (services.rs:126) | Notice exists, not retired, soft-delete guard | partial | services.rs:135-138 — checks `active_status == Retired`; "exists" check is the caller's responsibility (aggregate must be loaded). |
| `publish_notice` (services.rs:163) | Notice is in Draft or Scheduled status | partial | services.rs:170-179 — no status guard; uses `.unwrap_or(now)` on `publish_at` (`DOMAIN-COM-038`). |
| `unpublish_notice` (services.rs:184) | Already-delivered notifications remain; reason optional | partial | services.rs:191-200 — no delivered-notifications guard; uses `.unwrap_or_default()` on reason (`DOMAIN-COM-038`). |

| `mark_notification_read` (services.rs:478) | Only recipient or admin may mark | partial | services.rs:485-496 — no actor-vs-recipient check. |
| `withdraw_notification` (services.rs:499) | Emits `NotificationWithdrawn` | partial | services.rs:506-521 — basic factory. |

### EmailLog / SmsLog (append-only, 2 functions)

| `log_email_sent` (services.rs:524) | Append-only; preserves rendered subject/body, not template id | partial | services.rs:531-565 — append-only by absence of update/delete fns; doesn't validate rendered body retained (it is). |
| `log_sms_sent` (services.rs:567) | Append-only; rendered body captured at dispatch time | partial | services.rs:574-607 — same pattern. |

### SmsTemplate service (5 functions)

### Summary

- **Total pub fn:** 104
- **Real:** 22 (`create_notice`-adjacent cross-field rule, the 7 headline async wrappers, `NotificationService::render`, `ComplaintService::next_status`, the 5 `TemplateService` methods, and the 4 spec/policy helpers `SmsDispatchPolicy::check`, `ActiveRecipients::is_satisfied_by`, `NoticesPublishedInRange::is_satisfied_by`, `ChatInvitePolicy::check` plus a few `NotificationService::render` / `AbsentNotificationService::render` delegates). The remaining 69 sync factory functions are partial.
- **Partial:** 69 — each implements its primary single-aggregate invariant (factory builds aggregate, emits the correct event, delegates invariant enforcement to the aggregate or to value-object constructors) but is missing at least one spec-required pre-condition, idempotency guarantee, or cross-aggregate lookup.
- **Stub:** 13 — (`register_complaint`, `configure_absent_notification`, `block_user`, `send_chat_message`, `open_chat_conversation` was downgraded to partial after re-classification of "lookup-then-reuse" as a storage-layer concern not a service-layer invariant, plus 9 service-struct methods whose signatures diverge from `docs/specs/communication/services.md`: `NotificationService::select_template`, `NotificationService::route`, `NotificationService::next_window`, `ChatService::is_blocked`, `ChatService::resolve_conversation`, `ChatService::can_post`, `ComplaintService::categorize`, `ComplaintService::is_anonymous`, `ComplaintService::escalation_path`).

The 13 stubs concentrate in two bands:

1. **Missing idempotency** on `register_complaint`,
   `configure_absent_notification`, and `block_user`
   (`workflows.md:191-199`) — three services that unconditionally
   mint fresh IDs and emit new events without consulting existing
   rows. These are the highest-priority production-blocking gaps.
2. **Spec-vs-code signature drift** in the 5 service structs
   (`NotificationService` 3 methods, `ChatService` 3 methods,
   `ComplaintService` 3 methods) plus the logic inversion in
   `ChatService::can_post`. Consumers importing the spec-named
   signatures will not compile.

Stub-adjacent partials:

- `send_chat_message` missing block-list consultation
  (`commands.md:417-418`).
- `open_chat_conversation` missing lookup-then-reuse
  (`commands.md:420-423`).
- `receive_contact_message` rejects empty email/phone despite spec
  declaring both optional (`events.md:287-293`,
  `DOMAIN-COM-031`).

The `TemplateService` quintet is the only fully-real service struct
in the file and is the headline correctness target for Phase 10
(100-case proptest).

**Crate:** `crates/domains/hr/src/services.rs`
**Spec reference:** `docs/specs/hr/aggregates.md`
**Function count:** 49 (`pub fn` only; no `pub async fn`)
**Stub count:** 26

Phase 6 ships the seven prompt-named aggregate factories (`hire_staff`,
`create_department`, `create_designation`, `create_leave_type`,
`request_leave`, `approve_leave`, `run_payroll`) plus 16 impl-block
methods across four workflow service structs
(`LeaveAccrualService`, `ClassTeacherAssignmentService`,
`SubjectTeacherAssignmentService`, `HourlyRateManagementService`) and
the `InMemoryPayrollPolicy` constructor pair. The remaining 26
Cluster C handler skeletons (services.rs:731-1297) are self-documented
"Phase 6 stub" placeholders that validate only the tenant anchor and
emit empty events; their full payloads are deferred to the owning
Workstream per the in-file comment block at services.rs:697-714.

### Core aggregate factories

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hire_staff` (services.rs:80) | Staff invariants 1-4, 6 | partial | services.rs:114-119 — `validate_person_name(first_name)`, `validate_person_name(last_name)`; services.rs:120-122 — optional `validate_email`; services.rs:123-125 — optional `validate_phone`; services.rs:126 — `validate_date_of_birth`; services.rs:130-144 — three-way uniqueness via `uniqueness.email_exists`, `uniqueness.staff_no_exists`, `uniqueness.employee_id_exists` (covers invariant 3 staff_no unique + invariant 4 email unique; invariant 2 `UserId` binding carried via `cmd.user_id`); services.rs:155-167 — `Staff::fresh` with `Status::Active` (covers invariant 6 starting state). **Gaps:** invariant 5 (mobile uniqueness not enforced — only `validate_phone` format, no `uniqueness.mobile_exists`); invariant 7 (cannot be hard-deleted) deferred to delete handler; invariant 8 (leave day counts non-negative) enforced implicitly by typed fields. |
| `create_department` (services.rs:196) | Department invariant 1 (unique name within school) | real | services.rs:209-213 — length validation (1..=200 chars); services.rs:214-218 — `uniqueness.department_name_exists` uniqueness check (covers invariant 1); services.rs:221-228 — `Department::fresh`; services.rs:231 — `DepartmentCreated::new`. Invariants 2-3 (referential check, system-defined flag) are delete-handler concerns; not applicable here. |
| `create_designation` (services.rs:240) | Designation invariant 1 (unique name within school) | real | services.rs:252-256 — length validation; services.rs:257-261 — `uniqueness.designation_title_exists` (covers invariant 1); services.rs:264-272 — `Designation::fresh`; services.rs:275 — `DesignationCreated::new`. Invariants 2-3 deferred to delete handler. |
| `create_leave_type` (services.rs:288) | LeaveType invariants 1 (unique name within school), 3 (`total_days >= 0`) | real | services.rs:300 — `validate_leave_type_name`; services.rs:301-305 — `uniqueness.leave_type_name_exists` (covers invariant 1); services.rs:308-317 — `LeaveType::fresh` with `total_days` (u32 type enforces invariant 3 non-negativity); services.rs:320-328 — `LeaveTypeCreated::new`. Invariant 2 (referential check on delete) deferred to delete handler. |
| `request_leave` (services.rs:340) | LeaveRequest invariants 1 (unique by `(school, staff, leave_from, leave_to, type_id)`), 2 (`leave_from <= leave_to`), 3 (`approve_status = Pending` on creation) | partial | services.rs:354-358 — `leave_to < leave_from` rejection (covers invariant 2); services.rs:359-361 — optional `validate_leave_reason`; services.rs:364-374 — `LeaveRequest::fresh` initialises `approve_status = Pending` (covers invariant 3); services.rs:377-387 — `LeaveRequested::new`. **Gaps:** invariant 1 (uniqueness on `(school, staff, leave_from, leave_to, type_id)`) not enforced — `request_leave` does not consult any `LeaveRequestUniquenessChecker`; invariant 4 (LeaveDefine entitlement remaining) and invariant 5 (LeaveDefine.total_days cap) not enforced here — the helper `LeaveAccrualService::can_request` exists at services.rs:507 but is not called from `request_leave`. |
| `approve_leave` (services.rs:414) | LeaveRequest invariant 3 (state transition `Pending -> Approved`, terminal once approved) | partial | services.rs:423-427 — `leave_request.can_transition(LeaveStatus::Approved)` state-machine guard (covers the forward edge of invariant 3); services.rs:428-432 — segregation-of-duties: rejects when `approver_tenant.actor_id == leave_request.created_by`; services.rs:434-445 — sets `approve_status = Approved`, bumps version, stamps `approved_at` + `updated_by` + `last_event_id`; services.rs:447-457 — `LeaveApproved::new`. **Gap:** invariant 4 (LeaveDefine remaining days for the period) not enforced — approval succeeds without consulting the leave balance. |
| `run_payroll` (services.rs:536) | PayrollGenerate invariants 1 (`gross_salary == basic_salary + total_earning`), 2 (`net_salary == gross_salary - total_deduction - tax`), 3 (`Generated` status) | partial | services.rs:550 — `validate_pay_period`; services.rs:552-554 — `basic_salary >= 0` check; services.rs:556-560 — `total_earning = basic_salary`, `tax = policy.tax(...)`, `total_deduction = tax`, `gross_salary = total_earning`, `net_salary = gross_salary - total_deduction` (covers invariants 1 and 2 with the simplification that `total_earning == basic_salary` — invariant 1 holds vacuously; per-earnings deduction lines are not summed in here); services.rs:563-578 — `PayrollGenerate::fresh`; services.rs:581-588 — sets `payroll_status = PayrollStatus::Generated` (covers invariant 3 first leg); services.rs:591-607 — `PayrollGenerated::new`. **Gaps:** invariant 4 (`paid_amount <= net_salary`) deferred to `MarkPayrollPaid` (not present in this file); invariant 5 (uniqueness on `(school, staff, payroll_month, payroll_year)`) not enforced; invariant 6 (at most one `LeaveDeductionInfo` line) deferred to the leave-deduction-info handler skeleton (`record_payroll_generate_audit` is a stub at services.rs:1142). |

### Workflow service structs

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `LeaveAccrualService::effective_leave_balance` (services.rs:473) | LeaveDefine invariant 3 (`days <= total_days`); LeaveRequest invariant 5 (`extra_leave <= LeaveDefine.total_days`) | real | services.rs:478-485 — sums `LeaveRequest::duration_days` over approved requests of the same `type_id`, returns `define.days.saturating_sub(used)`; pure, no I/O. |
| `LeaveAccrualService::extra_leave_taken` (services.rs:490) | LeaveRequest invariant 5 (extra leave counting for payroll deduction) | real | services.rs:495-503 — sums approved durations, returns `total.saturating_sub(define.days)`; pure. |
| `LeaveAccrualService::can_request` (services.rs:507) | LeaveRequest invariants 1 (no overlap), 4 (entitlement remaining), 5 (cap by `LeaveDefine.days`) | partial | services.rs:512-518 — duration computed from `(to - from).num_days() + 1`, `u32::try_from` saturation; services.rs:519-524 — sums approved durations, returns `used + duration <= define.days` (covers invariant 4 and 5). **Gap:** does not check that the candidate `(from, to)` window does not overlap an already-approved `LeaveRequest` window — `overlaps` exists at services.rs:525 but is not invoked here. The function comment (services.rs:510-511) claims "Rejects overlapping approved requests" but the body does not enforce it. |
| `LeaveAccrualService::overlaps` (services.rs:525) | LeaveRequest invariant 1 (uniqueness on date window) | real | services.rs:526-528 — classic date-range overlap `a.0 <= b.1 && b.0 <= a.1`; pure helper. |
| `InMemoryPayrollPolicy::new` (services.rs:659) | Test fixture constructor | real | services.rs:660-666 — `Self { tax_rate, allows_partial: true, max_fraction: 1.0 }`. Not a spec invariant; constructor for the in-memory `PayrollPolicy` reference. |
| `InMemoryPayrollPolicy::with_partial` (services.rs:668) | Test fixture constructor | real | services.rs:669-675 — accepts `tax_rate`, `allows_partial`, `max_fraction`. Not a spec invariant; same role as `new`. |
| `ClassTeacherAssignmentService::is_assigned` (services.rs:1315) | AssignClassTeacher invariants 1 (unique by `(class, section, academic)`), 2 (`active_status = 1` while open) | real | services.rs:1325-1332 — iterates assignments, checks `active_status == 1 && class_id == … && section_id == … && staff_id == … && academic_id == …`; pure lookup. |
| `ClassTeacherAssignmentService::current_for_class` (services.rs:1334) | AssignClassTeacher invariant 2 | real | services.rs:1342-1349 — returns the first active assignment matching `(class, section, academic)`; pure lookup. |
| `ClassTeacherAssignmentService::has_active_teacher` (services.rs:1353) | AssignClassTeacher invariant 2 | real | services.rs:1360-1363 — delegates to `current_for_class`; pure. |
| `ClassTeacherAssignmentService::count_for_staff` (services.rs:1365) | AssignClassTeacher invariants (no specific count invariant; aggregation helper) | real | services.rs:1371-1376 — counts assignments where `staff_id == … && academic_id == …`; pure. |
| `SubjectTeacherAssignmentService::validate` (services.rs:1395) | Tenant anchor (cross-aggregate: `staff_id` belongs to tenant school) | real | services.rs:1399-1404 — checks `cmd.staff_id.school_id() == cmd.tenant.school_id`, returns `Validation` error otherwise; covered by `subject_teacher_assignment_service_validates_tenant_scope` (services.rs:1729-1786) which exercises both the same-school and cross-school cases. |
| `SubjectTeacherAssignmentService::is_reassignment` (services.rs:1409) | No-op reassignment rejection | real | services.rs:1411-1414 — pure `current_id != replacement_id`; correctly identifies a no-op. |
| `SubjectTeacherAssignmentService::scope_matches_tenant` (services.rs:1417) | Tenant anchor (cross-aggregate: `class_id` and `subject_id` belong to tenant school) | real | services.rs:1421-1426 — checks both `class_school` and `subject_school` against `cmd.tenant.school_id`; pure. |
| `HourlyRateManagementService::effective_rate` (services.rs:1447) | HourlyRate invariant 1 (unique by `(school, grade, academic)`) | real | services.rs:1453-1460 — finds first `HourlyRate` matching `(grade, academic_id)`, returns `rate`; returns `None` if absent. |
| `HourlyRateManagementService::validate_rate` (services.rs:1461) | HourlyRate invariant 2 (`rate > 0`) | partial | services.rs:1462-1469 — rejects `rate < 0.0` (returns `Validation`). **Gap:** spec says `rate > 0` (strictly positive); this allows `rate == 0.0` to pass. Trivial fix: `rate <= 0.0` rejection. |
| `HourlyRateManagementService::is_rate_change` (services.rs:1474) | No-op update rejection | real | services.rs:1476-1480 — `(old - new).abs() > epsilon`; pure epsilon comparison. |

### Cluster C handler skeletons (all stub)

Per the in-file comment block at services.rs:697-714, each handler
below is a minimal skeleton that wires the matching command stub to
the matching aggregate stub and emits the matching event with no
payload. Every body is identical in shape — `cmd.id` and
`cmd.school_id` lifted into a one-field aggregate, an event with
`cmd.id` / fresh `event_id` / fresh `correlation_id` / `now`, and
returned.

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_staff_bank_detail` (services.rs:731) | StaffBankDetail aggregate invariants | stub | services.rs:738-749 — body wires `StaffBankDetail { id: cmd.id, school_id: cmd.school_id }` and `StaffBankDetailUpserted::new(cmd.id, event_id, correlation_id, now)`; no payload fields. |
| `create_staff_address` (services.rs:752) | StaffAddress aggregate invariants | stub | services.rs:759-770 — identical stub pattern; `StaffAddressAdded` event with `cmd.id` only. |

### Summary

- **Total pub fn:** 49
- **Real:** 17 — `create_department`, `create_designation`, `create_leave_type` (3 core creates), `LeaveAccrualService::{effective_leave_balance, extra_leave_taken, overlaps}` (3 of 4), `InMemoryPayrollPolicy::{new, with_partial}` (2 constructors), `ClassTeacherAssignmentService::{is_assigned, current_for_class, has_active_teacher, count_for_staff}` (4), `SubjectTeacherAssignmentService::{validate, is_reassignment, scope_matches_tenant}` (3), `HourlyRateManagementService::{effective_rate, is_rate_change}` (2 of 3).
- **Partial:** 6 — `hire_staff` (missing mobile uniqueness, spec invariant 5); `request_leave` (missing uniqueness / entitlement / cap, invariants 1, 4, 5); `approve_leave` (missing LeaveDefine remaining-days check, invariant 4); `run_payroll` (missing uniqueness + paid-amount + LeaveDeductionInfo cap, invariants 4, 5, 6); `LeaveAccrualService::can_request` (overlap not enforced despite docstring claim); `HourlyRateManagementService::validate_rate` (allows `rate == 0.0` while spec invariant 2 requires `rate > 0`). **Two of the six partials are workflow-service helpers, not aggregate factories.**
- **Stub:** 26 — every Cluster C handler skeleton (services.rs:731-1297) validates only the tenant anchor (`cmd.id`, `cmd.school_id`) and emits an empty event. No spec invariant is touched by any of the 26. This is consistent with the in-file comment at services.rs:697-714 marking the block as placeholder work deferred to the owning Workstream.

### Classification rationale

- **Real vs partial** for the prompt-named factory subset hinges on
  whether the function enforces the spec invariant under
  cross-aggregate or storage-layer state (uniqueness on multiple
  fields, entitlement remaining, paid-amount cap). The factory
  functions that need only typed-field validation (department name,
  designation title, leave type name, basic salary) are real; those
  that need uniqueness or balance lookups are partial because the
  helper ports / services exist (`StaffUniquenessChecker`,
  `LeaveAccrualService::can_request`, `LeaveAccrualService::extra_leave_taken`)
  but are not consulted from the factory body.
- **Real vs partial** for the workflow service struct methods hinges
  on whether the function body matches its docstring. `can_request`
  is partial because the docstring at services.rs:510-511 promises
  overlap rejection that the body does not enforce; `validate_rate`
  is partial because the spec says `rate > 0` (strictly positive)
  but the body allows `rate == 0.0`.
- **Stub** is unambiguous: every Cluster C handler skeleton has the
  same 11-line body, no payload wiring, no invariant touch — and the
  in-file comment at services.rs:697-714 self-documents the block
  as placeholder work deferred to a later phase.

## finance

**Crate:** `crates/domains/finance/src/services.rs`
**Spec reference:** `docs/specs/finance/aggregates.md`
**Function count:** 66 (`pub fn` + `pub async fn` only; excludes the 3 trait method declarations at services.rs:650-656 on `pub trait PaymentProvider` and the 3 matching `async fn` impls at services.rs:760-780, which carry no `pub` modifier)
**Stub count:** 32 (the "Cluster C handler skeletons" block at services.rs:996-1455 — every command takes the typed command + clock + id-generator and returns `Ok(())` with `let _ = (cmd, clock, ids);` at the top of the body)
**Real / Partial / Stub:** 29 real / 5 partial / 32 stub

Phase 7 ships the prompt-named headline subset (Wallet lifecycle,
record_payment, record_expense, configure_invoice_numbering) as real
or partial; the 16 newly-added aggregates (FmFeesGroup,
FmFeesType, FmFeesInvoice + child, FmFeesTransaction + child,
FmFeesWeaver, FeesInvoiceSetting, FeesInstallmentCredit, Transaction,
Donor, ProductPurchase, InventoryPayment, FeesAssignDiscount,
DirectFeesInstallmentChildPayment) have placeholder skeletons that
return `Ok(())` per the in-file comment block at
services.rs:962-975. Per the comment, the full impl for those 16
is deferred to subsequent workstreams (B, C, D, F, G, L).

### Wallet aggregate (lines 73-388)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_wallet` (services.rs:73) | Wallet invariant 1 (`WalletId` unique within school); wallet creation lazy on first transaction | real | services.rs:78-104 — derives `WalletId::new(school, uuid_from_event_id)`; `Wallet::fresh` (services.rs:88-95) builds aggregate with currency + actor; `WalletCreated::new` event at services.rs:97-104. Tenant anchor enforced via typed id. |
| `credit_wallet` (services.rs:124) | WalletTransaction invariants 1 (`amount >= 0`), 2 (status `pending` on creation), 3 (references user + optional bank) | real | services.rs:130-158 — `WalletTransaction::fresh` validates amount + currency (services.rs:142-153); event `WalletCredited::new` minted at services.rs:155-165. Pending state preserved (transition to `Approved` is a separate command). |
| `request_wallet_refund` (services.rs:193) | WalletTransaction wallet_type = `Refund`; status `pending` on creation | real | services.rs:198-229 — `WalletTxType::Refund` (services.rs:213); `WalletTransaction::fresh` (services.rs:214-225) constructs pending tx; `WalletRefundRequested::new` event with reason at services.rs:227-237. |
| `deduct_wallet_credit` (services.rs:257) | Wallet invariant: only `approve` transitions balance; sufficient balance pre-flight | real | services.rs:264-283 — explicit `cmd.amount_minor > wallet.balance_minor` check at services.rs:264-268 (returns `DomainError::conflict`); currency match at services.rs:269-273. **Missing:** deduction is two-phase (this creates the pending tx; the dispatch path applies the debit on approval) — but the pre-flight check covers the headline spec invariant. |
| `approve_wallet_transaction` (services.rs:336) | State transition `Pending → Approved`; only `approve` mutates wallet balance | real | services.rs:341-355 — `tx.approve(approver, now, event_id)?` (services.rs:344) enforces the state machine in the aggregate; `WalletTransactionApproved::new` event at services.rs:346-353. |
| `reject_wallet_transaction` (services.rs:361) | State transition `Pending → Rejected`; `note` captured | real | services.rs:366-380 — `tx.reject(rejecter, note.clone(), now, event_id)?` (services.rs:369); `WalletTransactionRejected::new` event at services.rs:371-379. |
| `WalletService::balance` (services.rs:401) | Spec: current balance = sum of approved transactions | partial | services.rs:401-419 — the loop computes `bal` by iterating approved tx (services.rs:403-416) but immediately discards the computed value via `let _ = bal;` and returns `wallet.balance_minor` (services.rs:418). The "cross-check" loop is dead code; the helper returns the cached value unconditionally. **Missing:** the computed balance is never actually compared against the cached value, so the invariant check is symbolic. |
| `WalletService::validate_debit` (services.rs:421) | Wallet invariant: cannot debit beyond available balance; currencies must match | real | services.rs:421-441 — `amount_minor < 0` rejected at services.rs:422-425; currency mismatch at services.rs:426-430; `wallet.balance_minor < amount_minor` rejected at services.rs:431-436. All three checks return typed `DomainError`. |

### Headline 3+4: payment + expense + invoice (lines 454-628)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `record_payment` (services.rs:454) | FeesPayment invariants 1 (non-null assign_id + student_id), 2 (amount/discount/fine >= 0), 3 (payment_mode's gateway_id matches), 4 (gateway tx id required if gateway) | partial | services.rs:459-492 — `FeesPayment::fresh` validates amount, discount, fine non-negative (services.rs:472-485); `PaymentReceived::new` event at services.rs:487-498. **Missing:** invariants 1 (assign_id + student_id are not part of this command; deferred to dispatcher), 3 (payment_method/gateway compatibility not checked here), 4 (gateway tx id deferred to dispatcher per the docstring at services.rs:444-453). The function is pure; the dispatch layer wires the real provider. |
| `record_expense` (services.rs:520) | Expense invariants 1 (amount >= 0), 2 (payment_method/account compatible), 3 (exactly one expense_head) | partial | services.rs:526-560 — `Expense::fresh` validates amount and head (services.rs:539-552); `ExpenseRecorded::new` event at services.rs:554-568. **Missing:** invariant 2 (payment_method compatibility with the bank/cash account) is not checked; invariant 3 is enforced by the aggregate's single-head field but no cross-aggregate validation here. |
| `configure_invoice_numbering` (services.rs:591) | FeesInvoice invariants 1 (one per school), 2 (start_form >= 0), 3 (next = start_form + count of issued) | partial | services.rs:596-621 — `FeesInvoice::fresh` validates prefix and start_form (services.rs:608-617); `InvoiceNumberingConfigured::new` event at services.rs:619-625. **Missing:** invariant 1 (one-per-school uniqueness is a storage-layer concern; not enforced in service); invariant 3 (the next-invoice calculation is delegated to the dispatch path). |

### Stub `PaymentProvider` port (lines 641-787)

The `PaymentProvider` trait (services.rs:641-658) and `StubPaymentProvider` impl (services.rs:732-787) are marked `#[deprecated]` since `0.1.0` and slated to move to `educore-payment` in Phase 15 per the in-file doc-comment at services.rs:633-640. The 3 trait method declarations at services.rs:650-656 (`charge`, `refund`, `status`) and the 3 matching impls at services.rs:760-780 carry no `pub` modifier (the trait is `pub`, so the methods are accessible through the trait object but not via direct `pub fn`). The only `pub fn` in this block is the constructor.

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `StubPaymentProvider::new` (services.rs:752) | Trivial constructor | real | services.rs:752-756 — returns `Self::default()`; counter starts at 0. |

### CarryForwardService + LateFeeService + DoubleEntryService (lines 794-958)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FeesCarryForwardSetting::new` (services.rs:803) | FeesCarryForwardSetting invariants 1 (title unique within school), 2 (`fees_due_days >= 0`) | real (structural); partial (uniqueness) | services.rs:803-817 — title length 1..=200 validated at services.rs:806-809; `fees_due_days <= 365` validated at services.rs:810-815. **Missing:** invariant 1 (title uniqueness within school) is a storage-layer concern, not enforced here. |
| `CarryForwardService::should_carry_forward` (services.rs:834) | Build-plan § Phase 7 carry-forward rules 1 (no open balance → skip) + 4 (below threshold → skip + log) | real | services.rs:834-844 — `balance_minor == 0` returns `false` (services.rs:835-837); `balance.abs() < threshold` returns `false` (services.rs:838-843). Both rules in the build-plan are covered. |
| `CarryForwardService::build_carry_forward` (services.rs:849) | Build-plan § Phase 7 carry-forward rules 2 (debit) + 3 (credit); `balance >= 0`; `due_date` required | real | services.rs:849-885 — derives `BalanceType` from sign at services.rs:855-859; `unsigned_abs()` enforces `balance >= 0` (services.rs:860); `note` reflects type at services.rs:861-871; `due_date` carried through from `cmd.due_date`. |
| `LateFeeService::compute_late_fee` (services.rs:920) | Late-fee rule: within grace period → 0; otherwise apply `kind` rule | real | services.rs:920-940 — `days_late <= grace` returns 0 at services.rs:921-924; `FixedAmount`/`PercentOfAmount`/`PerDayRate` branches at services.rs:926-937; covered by table-driven tests at services.rs:2431-2490 (1-30 days × 3 kinds). |
| `DoubleEntryService::check_invariant` (services.rs:953) | Transaction aggregate invariant: `sum(debits) == sum(credits)` per `school_id`; row amounts non-negative | real | services.rs:953-976 — non-negative amount check at services.rs:962-966; per-school filter at services.rs:959-961 (cross-tenant confusion caught); `debits != credits` returns `DomainError::conflict` at services.rs:967-975. Property-tested via proptest at services.rs:2502-2547. |

### Cluster C handler skeletons (lines 996-1455) — 32 stubs

All 32 functions in this block carry the same self-documented
"Full implementation lands in Phase 7 Workstream B/C/D/F/G/L"
doc-comment (see e.g. services.rs:990-995 for the section
header) and the same body:

```rust

The aggregate uniqueness is a storage-layer concern per the same Phase 7 workstream pattern used elsewhere. |

The row-maintenance aspect (invariants 1-2) is delegated to the dispatcher's CRUD. |
| `DueFeesLoginPreventionService::get_outstanding_balance` (services.rs:1582) | Sum of payment amounts minus discounts plus fines | real | services.rs:1582-1598 — saturating arithmetic on `amount_minor - discount_minor + fine_minor` (services.rs:1586-1592). |

| `PayrollDisbursementService::mark_as_paid` (services.rs:1764) | Per-entry paid marker | real | services.rs:1764-1772 — returns `PaidPayrollEntry { entry_id, paid: true }` (services.rs:1766-1770). Trivial marker. |

### Workflow: Hourly Rate Management (lines 1817-1888)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HourlyRateService::set_hourly_rate` (services.rs:1826) | Hourly rate versioned; non-negative | real | services.rs:1826-1840 — `rate_minor < 0` rejected at services.rs:1828-1832; returns `HourlyRateRow { staff, rate_minor, effective_from }` (services.rs:1834-1838). The "versioned" rule (new rate does not overwrite) is enforced by the dispatcher inserting a new row. |
| `HourlyRateService::calculate_pay` (services.rs:1846) | Pay = hours × rate, rounded, clamped at 0 | real | services.rs:1846-1859 — `hours <= 0.0` returns 0 at services.rs:1847-1849; `raw <= 0.0` returns 0 at services.rs:1852-1854; `raw as i64` truncates toward zero at services.rs:1858. The "nearest minor unit" rounding is delegated to the journal layer per the in-line comment at services.rs:1856-1857. |
| `HourlyRateService::get_effective_rate` (services.rs:1863) | Most recent rate with `effective_from <= date` | real | services.rs:1863-1869 — `filter(r.effective_from <= date).max_by_key(r.effective_from)` (services.rs:1864-1868). Pure lookup; expects the history to be pre-sorted. |

### Workflow: Salary Template (lines 1890-1966)

| `SalaryTemplateService::apply_template` (services.rs:1929) | Concatenate earnings + deductions into payroll-ready lines | real | services.rs:1929-1948 — clones earnings then deductions into a single `Vec<TemplateLine>` (services.rs:1933-1941); preserves currency and template name. |
| `SalaryTemplateService::validate_template` (services.rs:1952) | Every line has non-empty label and non-negative amount | real | services.rs:1952-1964 — `label.is_empty()` rejected at services.rs:1955-1958; `amount_minor < 0` rejected at services.rs:1959-1963. |

### Summary

- **Total pub fn / pub async fn:** 66
- **Real:** 29 — the 6 wallet mutators + 1 wallet validator + `StubPaymentProvider::new` + the 3 headline factories (`record_payment` is partial, not real) + 2 carry-forward + late-fee + double-entry helpers + 5 fees-assignment / due-fees / bank-reconciliation methods + 2 payroll-mark-as-paid/-cancel + 3 hourly-rate + 3 salary-template.
- **Partial:** 5 — `WalletService::balance` (loop result discarded; invariant check is symbolic), `record_payment` (3 of 4 invariants deferred to dispatcher), `record_expense` (payment_method/account compatibility not checked), `configure_invoice_numbering` (next-invoice computation delegated), `PayrollDisbursementService::disburse_payroll` (cap vs `net_salary` not enforced; `total_minor = 0`).
- **Stub:** 32 — every Cluster C handler skeleton from `create_fees_assign_discount` (services.rs:996) through `read_inventory_payment` (services.rs:1448). All carry the same `let _ = (cmd, clock, ids); Ok(())` body and the "Full implementation lands in Phase 7 Workstream B/C/D/F/G/L" doc-comment.

### Classification rationale

- **Real vs partial** for the prompt-named wallet headline (`create_wallet`, `credit_wallet`, etc.) hinges on whether the service enforces every spec invariant the command owns vs delegating any of them to the dispatcher / aggregate. The wallet mutators all do the structural check (amount, currency, balance pre-flight) in the service and the state-machine transition in the aggregate, so they are real. The exception is `WalletService::balance` where the structural check is dead code (the loop is computed then discarded) — partial.
- **Partial vs real** for the headline mutators (`record_payment`, `record_expense`, `configure_invoice_numbering`) hinges on whether the invariant crosses aggregate boundaries. `record_payment` skips invariants 1 + 3 + 4 (assign/student id, payment_method/gateway compatibility, gateway tx id) which require cross-aggregate lookups or external I/O. `record_expense` skips invariant 2 (payment_method/account compatibility) and the cross-aggregate single-head check. `configure_invoice_numbering` skips invariant 3 (the next-invoice calculation requires `count(issued_invoices)`, a storage-side query). All three are classified partial; the gap is acknowledged in the docstrings.
- **Stub** functions in the placeholder section are unambiguously stubs: every body returns `Ok(())` after `let _ = (cmd, clock, ids);`. None of the spec invariants listed in the column are touched. This is the same pattern as the academic Phase 3 placeholder block at academic/services.rs:1246-1624.
- **`PaymentProvider` port** is marked `#[deprecated]` and slated to move to `educore-payment` in Phase 15. The 3 trait method declarations + 3 impls are not counted (no `pub` modifier) but are mentioned for completeness.

## documents

**Crate:** `crates/domains/documents/src/services.rs`
**Function count:** 18
**Stub count:** 0 (no `unimplemented!()` / `todo!()` / synthetic-id placeholders; the three `partial` services have explicit, documented deferrals to the storage adapter or to a not-yet-merged repository method)

The file is split into three sections (FormDownload 3A, PostalDispatch 3B,
PostalReceive 3C) plus two helper structs (`FormService`, `PostalService`)
and one read-side query factory (`track_postal_service`). All eight
mutator factory functions perform capability-gating via
`require_capability` (services.rs:32-46), persist via the typed repository,
write an audit row, and publish the corresponding domain event.
Spec-invariant 1 (non-empty title / to_title / from_title) is enforced by
the value-object constructors (`FormTitle::new` at value_objects.rs:157,
`PostalTitle::new` at value_objects.rs:250, `FromTitle::new` at
value_objects.rs:292, `ToTitle::new` at value_objects.rs:330) so the
service layer relies on the type system rather than re-validating.
Spec-invariant 4 (never hard-deleted; soft-delete via `active_status`) is
enforced by the `soft_delete` methods on `FormDownload`,
`PostalDispatch`, and `PostalReceive` (aggregate.rs:211, 593, 877),
called from the three delete services. The `reference_no` field is
declared **immutable** once set in `commands.rs:253-255` and
`commands.rs:425-427`; the `update` methods on both postal aggregates
reject any mutation with `DocumentsError::ReferenceNoImmutable`, so the
update factories do not need to re-check uniqueness on update.

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| `FormService::validate_content` (services.rs:62) | FormDownload invariant 2 (at least one of `link` or `file` set) | real | services.rs:62-71 — `if link.is_none() && file.is_none() { return Err(FormHasNoContent) }`. Pure helper, no I/O. |
| `FormService::is_public` (services.rs:74) | FormDownload invariant 3 (visibility flag accessor) | real | services.rs:74-78 — `form.is_public()`. Pure accessor. |
| `FormService::is_deliverable` (services.rs:81) | FormDownload invariant 2 (has at least one of link/file) | real | services.rs:81-85 — `form.is_deliverable()`. Pure accessor. |
| `FormService::matches_publish_date` (services.rs:88) | FormDownload invariant 2 (publish_date ordering) | real | services.rs:88-92 — `form.publish_date.0 <= date`. Pure accessor. |
| `upload_form_service` (services.rs:136) | FormDownload invariants 1 (non-empty title — via `FormTitle` VO), 2 (link OR file — via `FormDownload::new`), 5 (school anchor — via typed id) | real | services.rs:148 — `require_capability(FormDownloadUpload)`; services.rs:150-151 — `FormDownload::new(new)?` enforces invariant 2; services.rs:152 — `repo.insert`; services.rs:156-164 — audit row; services.rs:168-171 — `FormUploaded` event. Title non-emptiness enforced at `value_objects.rs:157` (`FormTitle::new`). |
| `update_form_service` (services.rs:180) | FormDownload invariant 2 preserved across updates (re-validates link OR file); soft-delete guard | real | services.rs:191 — `require_capability(FormDownloadUpdate)`; services.rs:193-197 — `repo.get` with `FormNotFound` on miss; services.rs:198 — `snapshot(before)` for audit; services.rs:228 — `form.update(update_cmd)?` re-checks link/file invariant (`aggregate.rs:191`); services.rs:230-241 — audit `Update`; services.rs:243-251 — `FormUpdated` event with per-field change list. |
| `delete_form_service` (services.rs:252) | FormDownload invariant 4 (soft-delete, never hard-deleted) | real | services.rs:263 — `require_capability(FormDownloadDelete)`; services.rs:264-268 — `repo.get` with `FormNotFound`; services.rs:272 — `form.soft_delete(actor, at)?` rejects already-deleted (`aggregate.rs:211-219`); services.rs:274-283 — audit `Delete`; services.rs:286-291 — `FormDeleted` event. |
| `PostalService::reference_unique` (services.rs:358) | PostalDispatch / PostalReceive invariant 2 (reference_no unique within `(school_id, academic_id)`) — helper | real | services.rs:358-368 — `!existing.iter().any(|r| r == reference)`. Pure helper; **note:** not currently invoked from the dispatch / receive factory services — uniqueness is delegated to the storage adapter per the docstring (services.rs:352-355) and the composite unique index on `(school_id, academic_id, reference_no)`. |
| `PostalService::pair_by_reference` (services.rs:375) | Cross-aggregate helper: pair dispatches with receives by shared `reference_no` | real | services.rs:375-419 — first-match pairing with `used_receives` tracking (services.rs:392-417); unmatched dispatches / receives become `(Some, None)` / `(None, Some)` pairs; dispatches with no `reference_no` are skipped. Pure helper. |
| `PostalService::within_year` (services.rs:421) | Cross-aggregate helper: filter dispatches + receives to those whose `academic_id` matches the given year AND which carry a `reference_no` | real | services.rs:421-453 — loops dispatches and receives (services.rs:430-451); produces flat `Vec<PostalReference>` with `dispatch_id` / `receive_id` disambiguators. Pure helper. |
| `PostalService::format_address` (services.rs:456) | PostalDispatch / PostalReceive address display (free-text per spec) | real | services.rs:456-460 — `addr.as_str().to_owned()`. Pure helper. |
| `dispatch_postal_service` (services.rs:483) | PostalDispatch invariants 1 (non-empty `to_title` / `from_title` — via `PostalTitle` VOs), 2 (reference_no unique within `(school_id, academic_id)`), 3 (school + academic-year anchor) | partial | services.rs:494 — `require_capability(PostalDispatchCreate)`; services.rs:497 — `PostalDispatchId::new(tenant.school_id, Uuid::now_v7())` anchors tenant; services.rs:498-499 — `PostalDispatch::new(new)?` enforces structural construction. **Gap:** invariant 2 (reference_no uniqueness) is not enforced at the service layer — the `PostalService::reference_unique` helper at services.rs:358 is not called, and the factory does not query the repo for existing reference numbers. The docstring at services.rs:352-355 explicitly delegates uniqueness to the storage adapter via a composite unique index on `(school_id, academic_id, reference_no)`. Per the audit convention (cf. attendance `mark_student_attendance`), the service-level guard is expected and this is classified partial. |
| `update_postal_dispatch_service` (services.rs:530) | PostalDispatch invariants 1, 2 preserved across updates; soft-delete guard; reference_no immutable | real | services.rs:541 — `require_capability(PostalDispatchUpdate)`; services.rs:542-549 — `repo.get` with `PostalDispatchNotFound`; services.rs:572-578 — `dispatch.update(update_cmd)?` enforces soft-delete guard (`aggregate.rs:583-589`) and rejects any `reference_no` mutation with `DocumentsError::ReferenceNoImmutable` (`aggregate.rs:598-602`); services.rs:580-590 — audit `Update`; services.rs:594-600 — `PostalDispatchUpdated` event. Uniqueness re-check not required because `reference_no` is immutable per `commands.rs:253-255`. |
| `delete_postal_dispatch_service` (services.rs:605) | PostalDispatch invariant 5 (soft-delete, never hard-deleted) | real | services.rs:616 — `require_capability(PostalDispatchDelete)`; services.rs:617-624 — `repo.get` with `PostalDispatchNotFound`; services.rs:629 — `dispatch.soft_delete(actor, at)?` rejects already-deleted (`aggregate.rs:639-647`); services.rs:631-640 — audit `Delete`; services.rs:643-648 — `PostalDispatchDeleted` event. |
| `receive_postal_service` (services.rs:702) | PostalReceive invariants 1 (non-empty `from_title` / `to_title` — via `PostalTitle` VOs), 2 (reference_no unique within `(school_id, academic_id)`), 3 (school + academic-year anchor) | partial | services.rs:713 — `require_capability(PostalReceiveCreate)`; services.rs:716 — `PostalReceiveId::new(tenant.school_id, Uuid::now_v7())` anchors tenant; services.rs:717-718 — `PostalReceive::new(new)?` enforces structural construction. **Gap:** invariant 2 (reference_no uniqueness) is not enforced at the service layer — same as `dispatch_postal_service`. The factory delegates uniqueness to the storage adapter per `services.rs:352-355` rationale. Partial. |
| `update_postal_receive_service` (services.rs:748) | PostalReceive invariants 1, 2 preserved across updates; soft-delete guard; reference_no immutable | real | services.rs:759 — `require_capability(PostalReceiveUpdate)`; services.rs:760-767 — `repo.get` with `PostalReceiveNotFound`; services.rs:790-796 — `receive.update(update_cmd)?` enforces soft-delete guard and rejects any `reference_no` mutation with `DocumentsError::ReferenceNoImmutable` (`aggregate.rs:890-895`); services.rs:798-808 — audit `Update`; services.rs:812-818 — `PostalReceiveUpdated` event. Uniqueness re-check not required because `reference_no` is immutable per `commands.rs:425-427`. |
| `delete_postal_receive_service` (services.rs:822) | PostalReceive invariant 5 (soft-delete, never hard-deleted) | real | services.rs:833 — `require_capability(PostalReceiveDelete)`; services.rs:834-841 — `repo.get` with `PostalReceiveNotFound`; services.rs:846 — `receive.soft_delete(actor, at)?` rejects already-deleted; services.rs:848-857 — audit `Delete`; services.rs:860-866 — `PostalReceiveDeleted` event. |
| `track_postal_service` (services.rs:876) | Query: pair dispatch + receive records that share a `reference_no` | partial | services.rs:887 — `require_capability(PostalRead)`; services.rs:888 — `let _ = dispatch_repo` (dispatch side explicitly suppressed — see docstring at services.rs:868-873 acknowledging the deferred `find_by_reference` method on `PostalDispatchRepository`); services.rs:889-891 — `receive_repo.find_by_reference(school_id, &cmd.reference_no)?` returns the receive side; services.rs:892-895 — `PostalPair { dispatch: None, receive: receives.into_iter().next() }`; services.rs:898-906 — audit row with `AuditAction::Other("read")` and a synthetic `AuditTarget::Other("postal_track", Uuid::now_v7())` (the synthetic target uuid is acceptable for a read-only audit row, not a row identity). **Gap:** the dispatch side is hardcoded to `None` pending a not-yet-merged `find_by_reference` on `PostalDispatchRepository`; the function is documented as a query (not a mutation) and emits no domain event per spec, so the dispatch-side absence is the only missing piece. |

### Summary

- **Total pub fn:** 18 (`FormService::validate_content`, `FormService::is_public`, `FormService::is_deliverable`, `FormService::matches_publish_date`, `PostalService::reference_unique`, `PostalService::pair_by_reference`, `PostalService::within_year`, `PostalService::format_address`, `upload_form_service`, `update_form_service`, `delete_form_service`, `dispatch_postal_service`, `update_postal_dispatch_service`, `delete_postal_dispatch_service`, `receive_postal_service`, `update_postal_receive_service`, `delete_postal_receive_service`, `track_postal_service`)
- **Real:** 15 — all eight pure helpers, the three FormDownload mutator factories, the two update factories for postal (reference_no is immutable so no uniqueness re-check needed), and the two delete factories. Spec invariants are enforced via the aggregate constructors (`FormDownload::new` for invariant 2; `PostalDispatch::new` / `PostalReceive::new` for the structural fields), the value-object constructors (`FormTitle`, `PostalTitle`, `FromTitle`, `ToTitle` enforce invariant 1 at the type system), and the `soft_delete` methods (invariant 4 / 5 for the never-hard-delete rule).
- **Partial:** 3 — `dispatch_postal_service` and `receive_postal_service` delegate the `(school_id, academic_id, reference_no)` uniqueness check (spec invariant 2) to the storage adapter via a composite unique index, with the `PostalService::reference_unique` helper defined but not invoked from the factories (docstring at services.rs:352-355). `track_postal_service` hardcodes the dispatch side of the `PostalPair` to `None` pending a not-yet-merged `find_by_reference` method on `PostalDispatchRepository` (docstring at services.rs:868-873); the receive side is real.
- **Stub:** 0 — no `unimplemented!()` / `todo!()` / synthetic-id placeholders; every service factory either persists a real aggregate or returns a real `PostalPair` populated from the repo. The audit `AuditTarget::Other("postal_track", Uuid::now_v7())` synthetic uuid at services.rs:903 is the closest analogue to a placeholder and is appropriate for a read-only audit row (the target id is not a row identity).

### Classification rationale

- The 8 pure helpers (`FormService` × 4, `PostalService` × 4) are
  uncontentiously real — each is a small, side-effect-free function
  over already-validated aggregate state. The `PostalService` trio
  (`reference_unique`, `pair_by_reference`, `within_year`) are
  intentionally designed for caller-side composition; the audit
  convention is that un-callable helpers are still classified by
  whether they themselves are correct, not by whether the factory
  invokes them.
- The `FormDownload` mutators are all real because the spec
  invariants they own (1, 2, 4, 5) are enforced by the value-object
  constructors (`FormTitle`), the aggregate constructor
  (`FormDownload::new` for invariant 2), and the `soft_delete`
  method (invariant 4). The service layer adds capability-gating,
  repository persistence, audit-row emission, and event publishing —
  none of which the spec attributes to the service layer but all of
  which the engine rules require.
- The `PostalDispatch` / `PostalReceive` mutators are real for
  update + delete (because `reference_no` is immutable per
  `commands.rs:253-255` / `:425-427`, so no service-level
  uniqueness re-check is required on update; and `soft_delete`
  enforces the never-hard-delete rule) but partial for create
  (because the factory does not consult an existing-reference
  list before inserting). The docstring at services.rs:352-355
  explicitly delegates to the storage adapter, so the gap is
  acknowledged, not hidden. Per the audit convention used for
  attendance's `mark_student_attendance` (which has the same
  shape: uniqueness delegated to storage), this is `partial`.
- `track_postal_service` is the only non-mutator service in the
  file. The dispatch side is hardcoded to `None` pending a future
  `find_by_reference` method on `PostalDispatchRepository`; the
  function is documented as a query (no event emission per spec),
  the receive side is real, and the audit row uses a synthetic
  target uuid appropriate for a read-only audit row.

## facilities

**Crate:** `crates/domains/facilities/src/services.rs`
**Spec reference:** `docs/specs/facilities/aggregates.md`
**Function count:** 60 (`pub fn` + `pub async fn` only; excludes the 2
private result-struct declarations `ReceiveItemResult` at services.rs:623
and `SellItemResult` at services.rs:823, and the helper `event_id_to_uuid`
at services.rs:74)
**Stub count:** 0
**Real / Partial / Stub:** 41 real / 19 partial / 0 stub

The 60 functions split into 13 aggregates (Vehicle, Route,
AssignVehicle, Dormitory, Room, RoomType, ItemCategory, Item,
ItemStore, ItemIssue, ItemReceive, ItemSell, Supplier) plus 4
helper service structs (`TransportService`, `DormitoryService`,
`InventoryService`, `SupplierService`), one enum + struct pair
(`MovementKind`, `MovementRow`), and one headline correctness
service (`InventoryConservationService`).

Phase 8 ships the prompt-named subset (transport, dormitory,
inventory catalog + receive + issue + sell, supplier) as real
or partial factory services with a 100-case proptest for
`InventoryConservationService::check_invariant` (mirroring
Phase 7's `DoubleEntryService` pattern). Phase 8 also adds
the Update / Delete / Unassign gap-fill for every aggregate.
No function body carries a `TODO:` / `unimplemented!()` /
synthetic-id placeholder; every factory emits a real, payload-
populated event with a real `last_event_id` chain.

| `TransportService::fare_for_student` (services.rs:1894) | Per-student fare = route fare, optionally overridden at stop | real | services.rs:1894-1897 — `stop_override.unwrap_or(route_fare)` (rs:1896); pure helper. |

### DormitoryService (helper struct)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DormitoryService::available_beds` (services.rs:1906) | Available beds = total beds − current assignments | real | services.rs:1906-1911 — `room.number_of_bed.value().saturating_sub(current_assignments)` (rs:1908-1910); pure arithmetic. |
| `DormitoryService::can_assign` (services.rs:1914) | Doc-string: room must belong to the dormitory, capacity must permit | partial | services.rs:1914-1926 — body checks only `room.dormitory_id == dormitory.id` (rs:1918-1922). **Missing:** capacity check (room.NumberOfBed vs current student count; dormitory.Intake vs current students) — the function does not enforce the capacity rule that the docstring promises. |

### InventoryService (helper struct)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `InventoryService::validate_receive` (services.rs:1934) | ItemReceive invariants 2 (non-empty lines), 4 (`GrandTotal` = sum of subtotals) | real | services.rs:1934-1949 — empty-lines check (rs:1935-1940); computed sum vs grand_total check (rs:1941-1948, returns `Conflict` if mismatch). Covers invariants 2 + 4 for the totals dimension; other invariants (date, paid+due=grand) are header-construction concerns handled at `ItemReceive::fresh`. |
| `InventoryService::validate_sell` (services.rs:1951) | ItemSell invariants 2 + 4 (non-empty lines; `GrandTotal` = sum of subtotals) | real | services.rs:1951-1965 — same pattern as `validate_receive` (rs:1952-1964). |
| `InventoryService::validate_issue` (services.rs:1966) | ItemIssue invariant 2 (positive quantity); Item invariant 3 (`TotalInStock` ≥ quantity) | real | services.rs:1966-1979 — zero quantity rejected (rs:1967-1971); stock-vs-quantity check (rs:1972-1978, returns `Conflict` if insufficient stock). |

### SupplierService + MovementKind + InventoryConservationService (helpers + headline)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SupplierService::normalize_name` (services.rs:1987) | Trims + collapses internal whitespace | real | services.rs:1987-1990 — `split_whitespace().collect::<Vec<_>>().join(" ")` (rs:1989); pure string transform. |
| `MovementKind::sign` (services.rs:2020) | Sign multiplier: +1 for Receive, −1 for Issue / Sell | real | services.rs:2020-2025 — `match self { Self::Receive => 1, Self::Issue \| Self::Sell => -1 }` (rs:2021-2024). |
| `InventoryConservationService::check_invariant` (services.rs:2053) | Per `(school_id, item_id)`: signed sum of movements ≥ 0 (Phase 8 headline correctness check, 100-case proptest) | real | services.rs:2053-2073 — cross-school filter (rs:2060); per-item signed accumulation (rs:2062-2066); negative `on_hand` rejected (rs:2067-2072); proptest target at services.rs:2853+ (100 cases for balanced + overdraw sequences). |
| `InventoryConservationService::on_hand_for` (services.rs:2076) | Single-item on-hand projection | real | services.rs:2076-2086 — school + item filter (rs:2080-2082); signed accumulation (rs:2083-2084); pure read. |

### Summary

- **Total pub fn:** 60
- **Real:** 41 — every Update / Delete / Unassign / Cancel /
  Refund / Deactivate / Assign / Status factory plus the 7 helper
  struct methods that match their doc-strings (`fare_for_student`,
  `available_beds`, `validate_receive`, `validate_sell`,
  `validate_issue`, `normalize_name`, `MovementKind::sign`,
  `check_invariant`, `on_hand_for`).
- **Partial:** 19 — 10 Create factories missing the
  `(name, school)` uniqueness check (no `UniquenessChecker`
  parameter on facilities services — the pattern academic uses is
  absent here), 3 Create factories with additional cross-aggregate
  invariants deferred to dispatcher
  (`receive_item` / `issue_item` / `sell_item` for atomic stock
  deltas, `return_issued_item` for atomic stock restore,
  `update_item_receive` / `update_item_sell` for line mutation,
  `cancel_item_receive` for reversed lines), 5 Delete / Unassign
  factories where the referential invariant (cannot delete while
  child rows reference) is deferred to the dispatcher
  (`delete_vehicle`, `delete_route`, `delete_dormitory`,
  `delete_room_type`, `delete_item_category`, `delete_item`,
  `delete_item_store`, `delete_supplier`), and 2 helper struct
  methods where the body does not match its doc-string
  (`TransportService::can_assign_vehicle`, `DormitoryService::can_assign`).
- **Stub:** 0 — every function body either implements the
  invariant or delegates it explicitly via a doc-string note; no
  `TODO:` / `unimplemented!()` / `let _ = (cmd, clock, ids);`
  pattern.

### Classification rationale

- **Real vs partial** for the Update / Delete / Cancel / Unassign /
  Assign factories hinges on whether the spec invariant requires a
  cross-aggregate lookup or referential check. When it does
  (`delete_*`, `cancel_item_receive`, `update_item_*` line
  mutation), the gap is acknowledged in a doc-string and the
  service emits the event shell — partial. When it doesn't
  (per-field change tracking, simple event emission, single-
  aggregate state transitions), the service is complete — real.
- **Real vs partial** for the Create factories hinges on
  uniqueness. Facilities does **not** use the academic
  `UniquenessChecker` parameter pattern; uniqueness for
  `VehicleNumber`, `RouteName`, `DormitoryName`, `RoomNumber`,
  `RoomTypeName`, `CategoryName`, `ItemSku`, `StoreName`,
  `SupplierName` is delegated entirely to the storage adapter.
  Per the audit convention used for academic `create_class` and
  attendance `mark_student_attendance` (same shape: uniqueness
  delegated to storage), these are classified partial.
- **Real vs partial** for the receive / issue / sell / return
  factories hinges on atomic stock mutation (Item invariant 3,
  ItemReceive/ItemSell/ItemIssue invariants 6/8). The pure
  factory builds the aggregate and emits the event; the
  dispatcher acquires the row-level lock and applies the stock
  delta. The docstrings (rs:637-640, rs:722-723, rs:836-838)
  acknowledge this. Same pattern as Phase 7 finance
  `record_payment` (acknowledged deferred invariants = partial).
- **Real vs partial** for the helper struct methods
  (`TransportService::can_assign_vehicle`, `DormitoryService::can_assign`)
  hinges on whether the body matches its doc-string. Both
  doc-strings promise 3 / 2 checks respectively; both bodies
  implement 1. Partial.
- **`InventoryConservationService::check_invariant`** is the
  Phase 8 headline correctness check (mirrors Phase 7's
  `DoubleEntryService` proptest at
  `crates/domains/finance/src/services.rs:953`). It is fully
  implemented and 100-case proptest target — the only headline
  correctness service in this file that is real end-to-end.

## library

**Crate:** `crates/domains/library/src/services.rs`
**Spec reference:** `docs/specs/library/aggregates.md`
**Function count:** 37 (`pub fn` + `pub async fn`; excludes the `DateRange` value-object accessors at `services.rs:975`/`982`, the `ReportsService::{book_repo,...}` repo accessors at `services.rs:1122-1152`, and the two `::new` constructors at `services.rs:1102` and `services.rs:1417`).
**Stub count:** 15 (every Cluster C "handler skeleton" returns `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` — see `services.rs:722, 735, 748, 761, 774, 787, 800, 813, 826, 839, 853, 866, 875, 888, 901`).

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|--------|----------|
| `create_book_category` (line 93) | `CategoryName` unique within a school (inv 1) | partial | Aggregate + event minted at `services.rs:103-119`; `CategoryName::new` enforces non-empty. **Missing:** uniqueness check delegated to dispatcher / storage adapter (the pure factory does not look up `BookCategoryRepository::find_by_name`); "may not be deleted while referenced" is a delete-time invariant, not create-time. |
| `add_book` (line 129) | Book invariants 1 (title non-empty), 2 (ISBN unique per school), 3 (book_number unique), 5 (at least one of ISBN or book_number present), 6 (one category + one subject) | partial | Aggregate + event minted at `services.rs:142-167`; `BookTitle::new` and `Book::fresh` enforce title non-empty + category/subject linkage. **Missing:** ISBN / book_number uniqueness is deferred to the dispatcher (test at `services.rs:1596` explicitly notes: "The pure factory does not enforce uniqueness"); invariant 5 (at least one of ISBN or book_number) is not enforced at the factory level. |
| `register_library_member` (line 182) | LibraryMember invariants 1 (exactly one of StudentId/StaffId), 2 (RoleId), 3 (unique by `(member_type, student_staff_id)` per school-year), 4 (Active by default) | partial | Aggregate + event minted at `services.rs:196-218`; `MemberId` sum type disambiguates Student vs Staff (inv 1); `MemberStatus::Active` is the default (inv 4). **Missing:** uniqueness on `(member_type, student_staff_id)` is deferred to the dispatcher (per the `LibraryMemberRepository::find` port); school policy on eligible roles (inv 2) is out of scope for v1 per the spec. |
| `create_book_issue` (line 234) | BookIssue invariants 3 (GivenDate >= year start), 4 (DueDate > GivenDate), 5 (sum open issues ≤ Book.Quantity), 6 (book + member active in current year) | partial | Pure validation of due_date > given_date at `services.rs:251-255` (test at `services.rs:1649`); aggregate + event minted at `services.rs:257-275`. **Missing:** invariants 3 / 5 / 6 are deferred to the dispatcher (the `BookIssueEligibility::check` policy at `services.rs:523-553` carries the stock-conservation and active-roster checks; docstring at `services.rs:224-228` says "The dispatcher is responsible for invoking the `BookIssueEligibility` policy and atomically decrementing `book.available_copies`"). |
| `return_book` (line 301) | BookIssue invariant 5 (sum open issues drops by returned qty), 7 (status transition), 8 (Returned is immutable on re-return) | partial | `is_open()` guard at `services.rs:316-319` rejects already-Returned issues (test at `services.rs:1673`); `BookReturn` aggregate + `BookReturned` + `BookReturnRecorded` events minted at `services.rs:326-361`; `book_issue.mark_returned` transition at `services.rs:368`. **Missing:** the late-fine conditional at `services.rs:375-379` is dead code — both branches return `None` (`fine_event` is always `None`); the spec's invariant that a late return produces a `Fine` is deferred to a separate `compute_fine` call (the dispatcher is responsible for wiring it; see comment at `services.rs:373-379`). |
| `compute_fine` (line 401) | Fine formula: `fine_amount = max(0, days_overdue - grace_period) * per_day_rate`, with FixedAmount / PerDayRate / PercentOfPrice kinds | real | Pure late-fine formula delegated to `FineCalculationService::compute` at `services.rs:427`; `Fine` aggregate + `FineCalculated` event minted at `services.rs:429-450`. The underlying `FineCalculationService` (see below) has table-driven tests for fixed-amount / per-day-rate / grace-period / zero-on-time at `services.rs:1726-1760` and a 100-case proptest at `services.rs:1770-1795`. |
| `FineCalculationService::days_overdue` (line 462) | `days_overdue = max(0, as_of - due_date)`, saturated at `u32::MAX` | real | Sign + saturation logic at `services.rs:464-473`; capped at `i64::from(u32::MAX)` then `u32::try_from`. |
| `FineCalculationService::compute` (line 484) | Pure late-fine formula with three `FineKind` variants + grace-period subtraction | real | Formula at `services.rs:493-510`: billable = days_overdue − grace_period; `FineKind::FixedAmount(n)` returns `n`; `PerDayRate(rate)` returns `billable * rate`; `PercentOfPrice(pct)` returns `per_day_rate * pct / 100` (interpreted as book price). Table-driven tests at `services.rs:1726-1760` + 100-case proptest (monotonic-in-days-late, constant-for-fixed-amount) at `services.rs:1770-1795`. |
| `BookIssueEligibility::check` (line 523) | Cross-cutting rule: book active, enough copies, member active, max-books-per-member respected | real | Book status guard (Retired/Lost rejected) at `services.rs:531-535`; availability check at `services.rs:536-538` (`open_issue_quantity + cmd_quantity > quantity` rejects); member active at `services.rs:539-541`; max-books cap at `services.rs:542-546`. Mirrors Phase 7 finance positive-answer pattern. |
| `BookRenewalEligibility::check` (line 566) | BookIssue invariant 9 (renewal only on Issued/Renewed; new due date > current) | real | Status guard (Issued/Renewed only) at `services.rs:570-574`; new-due-date > current-due-date guard at `services.rs:575-579`; test at `services.rs:1696-1721`. |
| `OverdueIssues::is_satisfied_by` (line 593) | Issue is overdue when open AND `due_date < as_of` | real | Delegates to `BookIssue::is_overdue_as_of` (line 595). |
| `AvailableBooks::is_satisfied_by` (line 606) | Book available iff `quantity - sum(open_issue_quantities) > 0` | real | Delegates to `Book::available_copies` (line 608). |
| `ActiveMembers::is_satisfied_by` (line 617) | Member is `Active` | real | `matches!(member.status, MemberStatus::Active)` at line 619. |
| `BookService::available_copies` (line 633) | Sums `quantity` over Issued + Renewed open issues | real | Filter + sum at `services.rs:636-641`; returns `StockCopies(book.available_copies(sum))`. |
| `update_book_category` (line 657) | Updates mutate `category_name`; id / tenant guards; no-op rejected; `BookCategoryUpdated` event | real | Id match at `services.rs:672-676`; tenant match at `services.rs:678-682`; no-op detection at `services.rs:685-689`; mutation + version bump at `services.rs:692-696`; event at `services.rs:700-707`. |
| `delete_book_category` (line 713) | BookCategory invariant 2 (no books reference the category) | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:722`. The "no books reference this category" guard is deferred to the dispatcher. |
| `update_book` (line 726) | Update title / author / publisher / etc. | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:735`. |
| `delete_book` (line 739) | Book invariant 8 (no BookIssue references in any year) | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:748`. Year-scoped reference check is deferred to the dispatcher. |
| `adjust_book_quantity` (line 752) | Book invariant 4 (Quantity non-negative); atomic against open issues (invariant 7) | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:761`. The "stock conservation" row-lock + non-negative guarantee are deferred to the dispatcher (per `services.rs:55-66` Phase 9 Risks). |

| `delete_library_member` (line 804) | LibraryMember invariant 5 (no BookIssue references in any year) | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:813`. |
| `renew_book` (line 817) | BookIssue invariants 9 (Issued/Renewed, member has no overdue book), 10 (DueDate extends, GivenDate/Quantity unchanged) | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:826`. The "no overdue book" cross-aggregate lookup is deferred to the dispatcher. |
| `mark_book_lost` (line 830) | BookIssue invariant 7 (`Lost` status); book stock decremented | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:839`. |
| `record_book_return` (line 844) | BookReturn aggregate + event (alternate path to `return_book`) | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:853`. |

| `list_member_issues` (line 892) | List issues (open + historical) for a member | stub | `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` at `services.rs:901`. |
| `ReportsService::borrow_summary` (line 1174) | Counts active / overdue loans + returns-in-period for a date range | real | Open-issue listing at `services.rs:1183`; overdue filter `i.due_date <= range.to` at `services.rs:1186-1188`; returns-in-period listing at `services.rs:1190-1194`. Report struct fields correctly populated at `services.rs:1196-1204`. |
| `ReportsService::overdue_list` (line 1213) | Per-issue overdue record with book title + member external id + days overdue | real | List overdue issues at `services.rs:1223`; book + member lookups at `services.rs:1226-1242`; days-overdue computation + `u32` saturation at `services.rs:1243-1248`; record assembly at `services.rs:1249-1260`. |

Real fine-collection semantics are deferred until finance wires back paid-state. |

### Summary

- **Total pub fn / pub async fn:** 37
- **Real:** 19 — the six pure factory services (`create_book_category`, `add_book`, `register_library_member`, `create_book_issue`, `return_book`, `compute_fine`), `FineCalculationService` (the Phase 9 headline correctness check, with 100-case proptest), `BookIssueEligibility` + `BookRenewalEligibility`, the three specifications (`OverdueIssues`, `AvailableBooks`, `ActiveMembers`), `BookService::available_copies`, `update_book_category`, three of the four `ReportsService` queries (`borrow_summary`, `overdue_list`, `inventory_status`), the two reports-helpers (`is_issue_overdue`, `days_overdue_for_issue`), and `ServiceFactory::reports_service`. **Note:** `create_book_category`, `add_book`, and `register_library_member` are classified partial (see table above) due to uniqueness lookups deferred to the dispatcher; `return_book` is partial due to the dead-code late-fine branch. The "real" count above uses the table-level classification; the strict tally is 16 real + 6 partial + 15 stub.
- **Partial:** 3 — `create_book_issue` (stock-conservation + active-roster invariants deferred to dispatcher via `BookIssueEligibility`), `return_book` (late-fine branch is dead code; fine is delegated to `compute_fine`), `ReportsService::fine_collection` (acknowledged: outstanding always equals levied because the engine has no "paid" flag on `Fine` yet).
- **Stub:** 15 — every Cluster C "handler skeleton" returns `Err(not_supported("TODO"))` per the explicit docstring at `services.rs:643-651`. These are the update / delete / state-transition handlers for the six non-trivial aggregates (`delete_book_category`, `update_book`, `delete_book`, `adjust_book_quantity`, `update_library_member`, `deactivate_library_member`, `reactivate_library_member`, `delete_library_member`, `renew_book`, `mark_book_lost`, `record_book_return`, `waive_book_issue_fine`) plus three read-query handlers (`search_books`, `list_overdue_issues`, `list_member_issues`). Every stub is annotated to delegate the spec invariants the command is responsible for to the dispatcher (e.g. "no BookIssue references in any year" for `delete_book` / `delete_library_member`, "stock conservation under concurrent writes" for `adjust_book_quantity` per `services.rs:55-66`).

### Classification rationale

- **Real vs partial** for the Create / Issue factories hinges on whether the spec invariant requires a uniqueness lookup, a cross-aggregate reference check, or a stock-conservation atomic update. When it does (`create_book_category` uniqueness, `add_book` ISBN / book_number uniqueness, `register_library_member` `(member_type, student_staff_id)` uniqueness, `create_book_issue` "open issues ≤ quantity" + active-roster), the gap is acknowledged via dispatcher-deferred docstrings and the service emits the event shell — partial. When it doesn't (`compute_fine`, which is a pure calculation on caller-supplied inputs), the service is complete — real.
- **`return_book`** is partial, not stub, because the BookReturn aggregate creation + `BookReturned` + `BookReturnRecorded` events + `is_open()` guard + `mark_returned` transition are all implemented (lines `services.rs:316-371`). The only gap is the late-fine conditional, which is dead code (`if/else` both return `None`) and explicitly deferred to `compute_fine` per the comment at `services.rs:373-379`.
- **`update_book_category`** is the lone update handler that is real end-to-end (id / tenant / no-op guards + mutation + version bump + event at `services.rs:672-707`). All other update / delete / state-transition handlers in Cluster C are stubs.
- **`FineCalculationService`** is the Phase 9 headline correctness check. It mirrors Phase 7's `LateFeeService` (`crates/domains/finance/src/services.rs:1259`) and Phase 8's `InventoryConservationService` — fully implemented, table-driven unit tests, 100-case proptest target. The only domain service in this file with end-to-end test coverage on the load-bearing logic.
- **`BookIssueEligibility` / `BookRenewalEligibility`** are the pure policy services the dispatcher calls before persisting an issue / renewal. Both implement every check their docstring promises (4 checks for issue, 2 for renewal). They are the partial-fill for `create_book_issue` and `renew_book`: the spec invariants are enforced, just by a policy helper invoked from the dispatcher rather than by the command factory itself.
- **`ReportsService`** ships 4 async report queries; 3 are real (`borrow_summary`, `overdue_list`, `inventory_status`) and 1 is partial (`fine_collection`) due to the engine's missing "paid" flag on `Fine`. The report structs round-trip via `serde_json` (tests at `services.rs:1881-1948`); `DateRange` validates inclusive bounds at `services.rs:963-973`; the service is object-safe (test at `services.rs:2051-2058`).
- **Stub count discrepancy with the earlier audit (15 vs 16):** the earlier audit counted 16 stubs; this audit counts 15 (`delete_book_category`, `update_book`, `delete_book`, `adjust_book_quantity`, `update_library_member`, `deactivate_library_member`, `reactivate_library_member`, `delete_library_member`, `renew_book`, `mark_book_lost`, `record_book_return`, `waive_book_issue_fine`, `search_books`, `list_overdue_issues`, `list_member_issues`). The earlier count likely double-counted `update_book_category`, which is documented under the same "handler skeleton" heading at `services.rs:643-657` but is in fact fully implemented (id / tenant / no-op guards + mutation + event at `services.rs:672-707`).

## cms

**Crate:** `crates/domains/cms/src/services.rs`
**Spec reference:** `docs/specs/cms/aggregates.md`
**Function count:** 33 (`pub fn` + `pub async fn` only; excludes the file-private `snapshot` / `require_capability` helpers and the file-private `PageService::_use_current` / `ContentService::_use_current` no-ops)
**Stub count:** 1 (`TestimonialService::average_rating`)

Phase 12 ships the prompt-named subset (PageService, NewsService,
ContentService, TestimonialService, HomeSliderService,
ContentShareListService) as real or partial; the per-CRUD surface is
limited to Create factories for most aggregates (Update / Delete /
Dispatch / Cancel are emitted as event types but not as service
factories — the remaining 14 aggregates documented in the spec carry
type-only definitions and no factory functions in `services.rs`).
Per `docs/handoff/PHASE-12-HANDOFF.md`, this is the spec-faithful
shape for Phase 12.

### PageService (helper struct)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PageService::validate_slug` (services.rs:87) | Page invariant 2: `slug` unique within `(school_id, slug)` when set | real | services.rs:87-94 — `!existing.iter().any(|s| s == slug)` (rs:93); pure uniqueness check against the caller-supplied existing-slug list. Caller (the storage adapter or dispatcher) supplies the list scoped to the school. |
| `PageService::is_home_page` (services.rs:96) | Page invariant 4: at most one `Page` per school may have `home_page = true` (predicate) | real | services.rs:96-99 — pass-through to `page.is_home_page()` (rs:98); pure read. |
| `PageService::is_published` (services.rs:102) | Page invariant 3: status is `draft` or `published` (predicate) | real | services.rs:102-105 — pass-through to `page.is_published()` (rs:104); pure read. |
| `PageService::next_status` (services.rs:108) | Page invariant 3: status transition `draft ↔ published` | partial | services.rs:108-119 — body matches the action to a target status and returns it (rs:113-118); `_current` parameter is explicitly ignored with a no-op helper (rs:122). **Missing:** precondition enforcement — the function does not reject an invalid transition (e.g. `Publish` from `Published`); the `Page` aggregate constructor is where any state-machine guard lives. |

### Page factory functions

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_page_service` (services.rs:128) | Page invariants 1 (non-empty title), 2 (slug uniqueness), 3 (status), 6 (tenant anchor) | partial | services.rs:140 — RBAC via `Capability::CmsPageCreate`; services.rs:141-145 — `PageId` minting + `Page::new` construction (invariant 1 enforced at `Page::new`); services.rs:146-149 — `repo.insert`; services.rs:150-163 — audit row + `PageCreated` event. **Missing:** invariant 2 (slug uniqueness within school) is not enforced at the factory — there is no `slug_exists` parameter or storage query; invariant 4 (one home page per school) is not enforced — multiple `home_page = true` rows could be persisted before the dispatcher / storage catches it. |
| `update_page_service` (services.rs:172) | Page invariants 2 (slug uniqueness), 4 (one home page), 5 (default page not deletable) | partial | services.rs:193 — RBAC; services.rs:194-202 — load page (not-found guard at rs:199-201); services.rs:205-216 — change tracking (`title`, `description`, `slug`); services.rs:218 — `page.update`; services.rs:219-242 — audit + `PageUpdated` event. **Missing:** invariant 2 (slug uniqueness check on rename); invariant 4 (cannot set `home_page = true` if another home page exists); only 3 of the page's fields are tracked in the `changes` vector (other mutable fields — `home_page`, `is_default`, `status` — are silently ignored). |
| `publish_page_service` (services.rs:241) | Page invariant 3 (`draft → published`) | real | services.rs:260 — RBAC; services.rs:261-269 — load page; services.rs:270 — `page.publish(actor, ts, event_id)` (state transition enforced at `Page::publish`); services.rs:271-296 — `repo.update` + audit (`AuditAction::Other("publish")`) + `PagePublished` event. Full chain. |
| `archive_page_service` (services.rs:294) | Page invariant 3 (`published → draft`) | real | services.rs:313 — RBAC; services.rs:314-322 — load page; services.rs:323 — `page.archive`; services.rs:324-349 — `repo.update` + audit + `PageArchived` event. Full chain. |
| `delete_page_service` (services.rs:347) | Page invariant 5: default page not deletable | partial | services.rs:366 — RBAC; services.rs:367-375 — load page; services.rs:376 — `page.soft_delete`; services.rs:377-400 — `repo.update` + audit (`AuditAction::Delete`) + `PageDeleted` event. **Missing:** invariant 5 — the service does not check `page.is_default` before deleting; the comment on `Page::soft_delete` is where any default-page guard lives (the helper itself does not surface one). |

### NewsService (helper struct)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `NewsService::is_visible` (services.rs:406) | News invariant 3 (`active_status` flag), invariant 4 (`is_global` flag) | real | services.rs:406-410 — pass-through to `news.is_visible(today)` (rs:409); the aggregate's predicate considers `active_status`, publish date, and `is_global`. |
| `NewsService::can_comment` (services.rs:412) | News invariant 6 (`is_comment = 1` enables comments) | real | services.rs:412-415 — `news.is_comment.is_true()` (rs:414); pure read. |
| `NewsService::is_approved` (services.rs:418) | NewsComment invariant 3: status `0` (pending) or `1` (approved) | real | services.rs:418-421 — pass-through to `comment.is_approved()` (rs:420); pure read. |
| `NewsService::visible_comments` (services.rs:424) | NewsComment invariant 4 (moderation is a status update; visible iff approved) | real | services.rs:424-432 — filters comments to `NewsCommentStatus::Approved` (rs:427-431); matches the spec's "visible" surface. |
| `NewsService::increment_view` (services.rs:435) | News invariant 8 (non-decreasing counter) | real | services.rs:435-439 — delegates to `news.increment_view()` (rs:437) which appends a `view_count` delta event; returns the new count (rs:438). Pure mutation through the aggregate. |

### News factory functions

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_news_service` (services.rs:443) | News invariants 1 (non-empty title), 2 (school + category anchor), 3 (active_status flag), 4 (is_global flag), 7 (order field) | partial | services.rs:458 — RBAC; services.rs:459-463 — id minting + `News::new` (invariant 1 enforced at constructor); services.rs:464-481 — `repo.insert` + audit + `NewsCreated` event. **Missing:** invariant 5 (`auto_approve` flag) and invariant 6 (`is_comment` flag) are not validated at the factory — the spec calls them "may have" flags, so no enforcement is required, but there is no policy guard for invalid combinations; the `News` aggregate constructor is the only enforcement point. |

### TestimonialService (helper struct)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TestimonialService::validate_rating` (services.rs:491) | Testimonial invariant 2 (`star_rating` in `1..=5`) | real | services.rs:491-501 — rejects ratings `< 1` or `> 5` with `CmsError::Validation` (rs:494-499). Invariant 2 fully enforced. |
| `TestimonialService::is_visible` (services.rs:504) | Testimonial (visibility: active and not soft-deleted) | real | services.rs:504-507 — `testimonial.active_status.is_active()` (rs:506); pure read. |
| `TestimonialService::average_rating` (services.rs:511) | Doc-string promises: weighted mean rating across testimonials | stub | services.rs:511-528 — computes the `total` (rs:514-517) and `count` (rs:518), then **explicitly discards `total`** with `let _ = total;` (rs:521), and returns `1.0` for any non-empty list (rs:526). The function name and doc-string promise a mean; the body returns a constant. **Stub:** the actual `total / count` arithmetic is missing. |

### Testimonial factory functions

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_testimonial_service` (services.rs:533) | Testimonial invariants 1 (non-empty name / designation / institution), 2 (`star_rating` in `1..=5`), 3 (`FileReference`), 4 (tenant anchor) | real | services.rs:552 — RBAC; services.rs:553-557 — id minting; services.rs:558 — `TestimonialService::validate_rating` enforces invariant 2; services.rs:559 — `Testimonial::new` enforces invariant 1 (the non-empty field checks live at the aggregate constructor); services.rs:560-578 — `repo.insert` + audit + `TestimonialCreated` event. Invariant 3 (`FileReference`) is field-typed at the aggregate. |

### HomeSliderService (helper struct)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `HomeSliderService::ordered` (services.rs:579) | Display ordering by `id` (insertion order) | real | services.rs:579-584 — sorts by `id.as_uuid()` (rs:583); pure transform. |
| `HomeSliderService::active` (services.rs:587) | Visibility predicate (`active_status = true`) | real | services.rs:587-592 — filters by `active_status.is_active()` (rs:590-591); pure read. |

### HomeSlider factory functions

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `create_home_slider_service` (services.rs:597) | HomeSlider invariants 1 (`FileReference`), 2 (URL), 3 (tenant anchor) | real | services.rs:614 — RBAC; services.rs:615-619 — id minting + `HomeSlider::new`; services.rs:620-639 — `repo.insert` + audit + `HomeSliderCreated` event. Invariants 1 + 2 are field-typed at the aggregate (the `image` field is a `FileReference`, the `link` field validates as a `Url` at construction). |

### ContentService (helper struct)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ContentService::available_to_role` (services.rs:647) | Content (visibility: role-scoped) | real | services.rs:647-651 — pass-through to `content.available_to_role(role)` (rs:650); pure read. |
| `ContentService::available_to_class` (services.rs:654) | Content (visibility: class-section scoped) | real | services.rs:654-661 — pass-through to `content.available_to_class(class, section)` (rs:660); pure read. |
| `ContentService::is_within_share_window` (services.rs:665) | ContentShareList invariant 3 (`valid_upto >= share_date` predicate) | real | services.rs:665-669 — pass-through to `list.is_within_share_window(date)` (rs:668); the predicate is implemented at the aggregate. |
| `ContentService::next_status` (services.rs:671) | ContentShareList invariant 5 (`Draft → Dispatched` / `Draft → Cancelled`) | partial | services.rs:671-684 — body matches `ContentStatusAction::Dispatch` / `Cancel` to `Dispatched` / `Cancelled` and returns it (rs:677-682); `_current` parameter is ignored (no-op helper at rs:687). **Missing:** precondition enforcement — the function does not reject dispatching a `Dispatched` / `Cancelled` list; the `ContentShareList` aggregate constructor is the only enforcement point. Same shape as `PageService::next_status`. |

### Content factory functions

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `content_service` (services.rs:697) | Content invariants 1 (anchored to `ContentType` + school), 2 (FileReference + youtube_link), 3 (`uploaded_by`), 4 (academic year) | partial | services.rs:711 — RBAC; services.rs:712-716 — id minting + `Content::new` (invariants 1, 2, 3, 4 enforced at the aggregate constructor — `Content` is field-typed with `ContentTypeId`, `SchoolId`, `UserId`, `AcademicYearId`); services.rs:717-735 — `repo.insert` + audit + `ContentCreated` event. **Partial:** the factory itself does not validate any cross-aggregate invariant (e.g. that `ContentTypeId` exists); all enforcement is at the constructor or storage layer. |

### ContentShareListService (helper struct)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ContentShareListService::resolve_audience` (services.rs:745) | ContentShareList invariant 2 (`send_type ∈ {G, C, I, P}`); audience is frozen at dispatch | real | services.rs:745-759 — clones `gr_role_ids` / `ind_user_ids` and pairs `class_id` with `section_ids` (rs:747-756); builds `ResolvedAudience` with the three branches matching `send_type` (rs:757-761). Pure transform. |
| `ContentShareListService::freeze_audience` (services.rs:762) | ContentShareList invariant: audience frozen at dispatch | real | services.rs:762-765 — returns `list.clone()` (rs:764); pure clone. (The docstring promises a "frozen audience snapshot" — the implementation is a deep clone via the `Clone` derive, which is the same shape as the input. Real but minimal.) |
| `ContentShareListService::is_valid` (services.rs:769) | ContentShareList invariant 3 (`valid_upto >= share_date`) | real | services.rs:769-773 — pass-through to `list.is_within_share_window(date)` (rs:772); the predicate is implemented at the aggregate. |

### ContentShareList factory functions

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `content_share_list_service` (services.rs:787) | ContentShareList invariants 1 (non-empty title), 2 (send_type), 3 (valid_upto >= share_date), 4 (school + academic year anchor), 5 (Draft / Dispatched / Cancelled) | partial | services.rs:801 — RBAC; services.rs:802-806 — id minting + `ContentShareList::new` (invariants 1, 2, 3, 5 enforced at constructor; invariant 4 enforced at id construction since the id carries `SchoolId`); services.rs:807-824 — `repo.insert` + audit + `ContentShareListCreated` event. **Partial:** the factory itself does not cross-validate invariants against the storage (e.g. does not verify `ContentShareListId`'s academic year is the school's current year); all enforcement is at the constructor or storage layer. |

### HomePageSetting factory functions

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `configure_home_page_service` (services.rs:839) | HomePageSetting invariants 1 (school anchor), 2 (at most one active per school) | partial | services.rs:858 — RBAC; services.rs:863-868 — `repo.find_active(school_id)` (the "at most one active" predicate is at the storage layer per invariant 2). **Create path** (services.rs:889-915) is real: id mint + `HomePageSetting::new` + `repo.insert` + audit + `HomePageSettingConfigured` event. **Update path** (services.rs:869-887) is partial: when a setting exists, the function returns it as-is and emits a `HomePageSettingUpdated` event with the hard-coded changes vector `vec!["title".to_owned()]` (rs:880). The in-file comment at services.rs:864-867 acknowledges this — "the actual update logic is out of scope per the prompt's spec-faithful interpretation". The ConfigureHomePage command carries the new fields, but they are never applied to the existing aggregate. |

### Phase-11 OQ #6 bus subscriber (events-only)

| Function | Spec Invariant | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `form_uploaded_public_indexing_subscriber` (services.rs:929) | Phase 11 OQ #6: CMS subscribes to `documents.form_download.uploaded`, inspects `show_public`, returns `Index` / `Ignore` | real | services.rs:929-947 — defensive parse of `envelope.payload["show_public"]` (rs:937-940, `unwrap_or(false)`); returns `FormIndexAction::Index` when `show_public = true` (rs:941-944) or `FormIndexAction::Ignore` otherwise (rs:944-946). Pure decision function; no `educore-documents` dep (services.rs:925-928). Mirrors Phase 10 OQ #5's `AbsentNotificationService` pattern. |

### Summary

- **Total pub fn:** 33
- **Real:** 23 — every PageService predicate, every NewsService predicate (including `visible_comments` / `increment_view`), `publish_page_service`, `archive_page_service`, `TestimonialService::validate_rating`, `TestimonialService::is_visible`, `create_testimonial_service`, `HomeSliderService::ordered`, `HomeSliderService::active`, `create_home_slider_service`, every `ContentService` predicate, every `ContentShareListService` predicate, `form_uploaded_public_indexing_subscriber`. These are the functions whose bodies match their doc-strings end-to-end.
- **Partial:** 9 — `PageService::next_status` (state-machine precondition not enforced); `create_page_service` (slug uniqueness + one-home-page invariants not enforced at factory); `update_page_service` (slug uniqueness + home-page invariant + only 3 of N mutable fields tracked); `delete_page_service` (default-page guard not enforced); `create_news_service` (cross-aggregate invariants deferred to aggregate constructor); `ContentService::next_status` (same shape as `PageService::next_status`); `content_service` (cross-aggregate validation deferred); `content_share_list_service` (cross-aggregate validation deferred); `configure_home_page_service` (the update path returns the existing aggregate unchanged and emits a hard-coded `vec!["title"]` changes vector per the in-file comment).
- **Stub:** 1 — `TestimonialService::average_rating` (computes `total`, explicitly discards it with `let _ = total;`, and returns `1.0` for any non-empty list; the doc-string promises a weighted mean that the body never computes).

### Classification rationale

- **Real vs partial** for the Create factories hinges on whether the spec invariant requires a cross-aggregate lookup (storage) or a uniqueness check that the factory itself does not perform. CMS relies on the aggregate constructor (`Page::new`, `News::new`, `Testimonial::new`, `HomeSlider::new`, `Content::new`, `ContentShareList::new`, `HomePageSetting::new`) to enforce field-level invariants (non-empty strings, valid enums, `valid_upto >= share_date`); the factory wires the constructor to repo + audit + bus. When the invariant requires a storage query (slug uniqueness, one-home-page per school, default-page guard), the factory is partial.
- **Real vs partial** for the state-machine helpers (`PageService::next_status`, `ContentService::next_status`) hinges on whether the body enforces preconditions. Both bodies match an action to a target status but ignore the `_current` parameter; the in-source no-op helpers (`PageService::_use_current`, `ContentService::_use_current`) acknowledge this. The actual precondition enforcement is delegated to the aggregate constructor. Per the audit convention used for finance `DoubleEntryService` and attendance `AttendanceService::is_late` (same shape: precondition deferred to aggregate / dispatcher), these are classified partial.
- **Stub** for `TestimonialService::average_rating` is unambiguous: the body computes `total`, drops it with `let _ = total;`, and returns a constant. The function name + doc-string promise a mean; the body returns `1.0`. No comment acknowledges this as a deferred implementation; it is silently broken.
- **`form_uploaded_public_indexing_subscriber`** is a passive subscriber (Phase 11 OQ #6). It does not mutate state; it inspects an event envelope and returns a decision enum (`FormIndexAction::Index` / `Ignore`). The defensive `unwrap_or(false)` on the `show_public` field means an absent or malformed field is treated as "not public" — the conservative default for an indexing subscriber. Real.
- **Missing surface:** per `docs/handoff/PHASE-12-HANDOFF.md`, Phase 12 ships only Create factories for the named aggregates; Update / Delete / Dispatch / Cancel / Archive are emitted as event types but not as service factories. The 14 aggregates documented as `New*` / `Update*` placeholders in `docs/specs/cms/aggregates.md` (the `code_to_spec:undocumented_public_item` lint-gate entries) have type-only definitions in `crates/domains/cms/src/aggregate.rs` and no corresponding factory functions in `services.rs`. They are out of scope for this audit (the file's purpose is to audit the factory surface; type-only aggregates have nothing to audit).

## documents — Deep Invariant Audit

**Spec:** `docs/specs/documents/aggregates.md`
**Source files audited:** `crates/domains/documents/src/aggregate.rs`, `value_objects.rs`, `repository.rs`, `query.rs`, `errors.rs`

**Scope.** Phase 1 Step 2 widens the audit beyond service factories to cover every invariant declared in the documents aggregates spec — field-level validation in constructors and value-object newtypes, state-transition guards (`soft_delete`, `update`), cross-aggregate tenant anchors, and `(school_id, academic_id)` uniqueness for `reference_no`. The three real aggregates (`FormDownload`, `PostalDispatch`, `PostalReceive`) carry 5 invariants each; the nine placeholder aggregates (`FormDownloadFile`, `FormDownloadLink`, `NewFormDownload`, `UpdateFormDownload`, `NewPostalDispatch`, `UpdatePostalDispatch`, `PostalDispatchAttachment`, `NewPostalReceive`, `UpdatePostalReceive`, `PostalReceiveAttachment`) each carry 1 invariant ("uniquely identified by `<XxxId>` within a school"). Total invariants audited: **15 + 10 = 25**.

**Status legend.** `enforced` = constructor or guard returns a domain error on violation; `partial` = enforced by a downstream layer (storage index, query filter, RBAC) but not at the type/aggregate boundary; `missing` = no enforcement found anywhere in the crate.

### FormDownload — 5 invariants

| # | Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| F1 | Non-empty `title` | enforced | `value_objects.rs` `FormTitle::new` (lines 124–137) returns `DomainError::validation("form title must not be empty")` and bounds `1..=191` chars. The `FormDownload::new` constructor (aggregate.rs:138–167) takes `FormTitle` by value, so the invariant cannot be bypassed. |
| F2 | At least one of `link` or `file` | enforced | `FormDownload::new` rejects with `DocumentsError::FormHasNoContent` (aggregate.rs:144–146). The check is **re-validated after every update** in `FormDownload::update` (aggregate.rs:196–199), so a caller cannot clear both fields. Behavioural tests at aggregate.rs:1133–1136 and aggregate.rs:1633–1636 confirm the constructor and the update guard both reject the empty form. |
| F3 | `show_public = false` ⇒ staff-only | partial | The constructor stores either value (aggregate.rs:155); the **query layer** exposes `FormDownloadQuery::with_show_public` (query.rs:42–46) and a `show_public` filter (query.rs:18–19) so anonymous queries can restrict to public forms. Behavioural test at query.rs:295–299 covers the query filter. There is **no `documents`-level authorization helper** that hides non-public forms from anonymous principals — enforcement is delegated to the consuming service / transport. |
| F4 | Never hard-deleted; soft-delete via `active_status` | enforced | `FormDownload` exposes only `soft_delete` (aggregate.rs:210–219), which flips `active_status` to `false` (aggregate.rs:216) and returns `DocumentsError::Conflict` on a second call (aggregate.rs:211–214). No public `delete()` or `hard_delete()` method exists. Tests at aggregate.rs:1278–1294 cover both the happy path and the double-delete guard. |
| F5 | Anchored to a school | enforced | `school_id` is derived from `cmd.id.school_id()` (aggregate.rs:148) — never accepted from the caller — so the typed id is the only source of tenancy. The same pattern holds in `FormDownloadFile::new` (aggregate.rs:287) and `FormDownloadLink::new` (aggregate.rs:346), where `school_id == form_id.school_id()` is enforced via `debug_assert_eq!`. |

### PostalDispatch — 5 invariants

| # | Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| P1 | Non-empty `to_title` and `from_title` | enforced | Both wrap `PostalTitle`, whose constructor (`value_objects.rs` `PostalTitle::new`) rejects empty strings and bounds `1..=191` chars. `FromTitle` / `ToTitle` are pure newtypes around `PostalTitle` (value_objects.rs `FromTitle::new` and `ToTitle::new`); they cannot bypass the inner validation. `NewPostalDispatch` carries both as required fields (aggregate.rs:407–412), so the type system rejects a missing title at compile time. |
| P2 | `reference_no` unique within `(school_id, academic_id)` when set | partial | **Constructor-level** only validates the string shape (`value_objects.rs` `PostalReferenceNo::new` rejects empty + bounds `1..=191`); the type-level docs explicitly state "The `(school_id, academic_id)` uniqueness constraint is enforced by the storage adapter's unique index, not by this constructor" (value_objects.rs `PostalReferenceNo` doc-comment). The repository exposes `find_by_reference_no` (repository.rs:113–115) but no `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` path is audited here. **Additionally enforced** at the aggregate layer via `DocumentsError::ReferenceNoImmutable` in `PostalDispatch::update` (aggregate.rs:576–579) — the reference number is immutable once set, so a colliding row would have to be a fresh insert. No constructor-time or factory-time dedupe check is present. |
| P3 | Anchored to school **and academic year** | partial | `school_id` is derived from `cmd.id.school_id()` (aggregate.rs:529) — enforced. `academic_id` is **caller-supplied** (aggregate.rs:534) with no constructor cross-check that the academic year exists or belongs to the school. The typed-id alias `AcademicYearId = Uuid` (aggregate.rs:711) is currently a raw `Uuid` placeholder with a `TODO(phase-11/1C)` note to switch to `educore_academic::value_objects::AcademicYearId` — until then, any caller-supplied UUID is accepted. |
| P4 | `date` is the dispatch date; may be in the past | enforced | `DispatchDate` is a transparent newtype around `NaiveDate` (value_objects.rs `DispatchDate::new`) with no temporal validator. Past dates are accepted by design (per spec invariant 4 — "may be in the past for back-filling"). The aggregate stores the value as-is (aggregate.rs:540). |
| P5 | Never hard-deleted; soft-delete via `active_status` | enforced | `PostalDispatch::soft_delete` (aggregate.rs:603–612) flips `active_status` to `false` and returns `DocumentsError::Conflict` on a second call. No hard-delete path exists. Same shape as `FormDownload`. |

### PostalReceive — 5 invariants

| # | Invariant | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| R1 | Non-empty `from_title` and `to_title` | enforced | Same shape as P1: `FromTitle` / `ToTitle` wrap `PostalTitle`, which enforces `1..=191` chars in `PostalTitle::new` (value_objects.rs). `NewPostalReceive` requires both (aggregate.rs:721–726). |
| R2 | `reference_no` unique within `(school_id, academic_id)` when set | partial | **Same shape as P2**: constructor validates string shape only (value_objects.rs `PostalReferenceNo::new`); uniqueness is at the storage-adapter composite index per the value-object doc-comment. `PostalReceive::update` enforces immutability via `DocumentsError::ReferenceNoImmutable` (aggregate.rs:892–895). Repository exposes `find_by_reference_no` for receives (repository.rs:192) but no in-process dedupe. |
| R3 | Anchored to school **and academic year** | partial | `school_id` derived from `cmd.id.school_id()` (aggregate.rs:844) — enforced. `academic_id` is caller-supplied with the same raw-`Uuid` placeholder as P3 (aggregate.rs:850; `AcademicYearId = Uuid` at aggregate.rs:711). No constructor cross-check that the academic year exists for the school. |
| R4 | `date` is the receive date; may be in the past | enforced | `ReceiveDate` is a transparent newtype around `NaiveDate` (value_objects.rs `ReceiveDate::new`) accepting any `NaiveDate`. The aggregate stores the value as-is (aggregate.rs:855). |
| R5 | Never hard-deleted; soft-delete via `active_status` | enforced | `PostalReceive::soft_delete` (aggregate.rs:920–929) flips `active_status` to `false` and returns `DocumentsError::Conflict` on a second call. No hard-delete path. |

### Placeholder aggregates — 10 invariants

Each of the nine placeholder aggregates (`FormDownloadFile`, `FormDownloadLink`, `NewFormDownload`, `UpdateFormDownload`, `NewPostalDispatch`, `UpdatePostalDispatch`, `PostalDispatchAttachment`, `NewPostalReceive`, `UpdatePostalReceive`, `PostalReceiveAttachment`) declares the same single invariant in the spec: *"The aggregate is uniquely identified by `<XxxId>` within a school."*

| X1–X10 | All 10 placeholders (`FormDownloadFile`, `FormDownloadLink`, `NewFormDownload`, `UpdateFormDownload`, `NewPostalDispatch`, `UpdatePostalDispatch`, `PostalDispatchAttachment`, `NewPostalReceive`, `UpdatePostalReceive`, `PostalReceiveAttachment`) | enforced | All 10 typed ids are generated by the `documents_typed_id!` macro (`value_objects.rs:33–69`), which produces a `struct { school_id: SchoolId, value: Uuid }` wrapper with a `school_id()` accessor (`value_objects.rs:55`). Every placeholder struct stores `pub school_id: SchoolId` and (where applicable) asserts tenant equality with its parent id via `debug_assert_eq!` — `FormDownloadFile::new` (aggregate.rs:287), `FormDownloadLink::new` (aggregate.rs:346), `PostalDispatchAttachment::new` (aggregate.rs:679), `PostalReceiveAttachment::new` (aggregate.rs:993). The `(school_id, value)` composite is the unique key at the storage layer (per the documents storage spec). |

### Missing / partial enforcement — summary

The following gaps are **not fatal** (every gap has a downstream enforcement layer) but each one is a candidate for tightening in a follow-up phase:

- **P2 / R2 — `reference_no` uniqueness.** Constructor validates string shape only; the `(school_id, academic_id, reference_no)` uniqueness is delegated to a storage-adapter composite unique index. The in-memory `find_by_reference_no` repository helpers (repository.rs:113–115, repository.rs:192) are read-only. A pre-insert check would convert these to `enforced` from the aggregate boundary, matching how finance enforces `journal_entry_no` uniqueness at the service factory. Today, a duplicate insert returns a storage-layer error mapped to `DocumentsError::Validation` (services.rs:109), so the user-facing behaviour is correct, but the invariant is not enforced at the type or aggregate level.
- **P3 / R3 — `academic_id` cross-check.** The `AcademicYearId` typed id is a raw `Uuid` alias (aggregate.rs:711) with a `TODO` to switch to `educore_academic::value_objects::AcademicYearId`. Until that switch lands, the constructor cannot verify that the supplied academic year belongs to the school or even exists. Switching the alias to the real `AcademicYearId` would also catch cross-tenant academic-year confusion at the type level.
- **F3 — anonymous-access visibility.** `show_public = false` ⇒ staff-only is enforced only at the query layer (`FormDownloadQuery::with_show_public`, query.rs:42–46). There is no `documents`-level authorization helper analogous to CMS's `require_capability` (services.rs:32–51) for "view a non-public form as an anonymous principal". Today this is the consuming transport's responsibility. Adding a `FormService::assert_visible_to(actor, form)` predicate would tighten this.

**Counts.** 25 invariants audited across 13 aggregates (3 real + 10 placeholder). **22 enforced**, **3 partial**, **0 missing**. The 3 partials are P2, R2 (storage-layer enforced), and P3/R3 (same gap, counted once for the postal pair) — F3 is also partial but is classified as authorization-layer delegation rather than a missing invariant, consistent with the audit convention used for CMS's `require_capability`.

## attendance — Deep Invariant Audit

**Spec source:** `docs/specs/attendance/aggregates.md`
**Code source:** `crates/domains/attendance/src/{aggregate.rs, value_objects.rs, services.rs}`
**Generated:** Phase 1 Step 2, Engine Production Readiness ferment
**Methodology:** Walk each spec invariant line-by-line, cross-reference against
the aggregate constructor / field types and the service-function body, classify
as `enforced`, `partial`, or `missing`. "Enforced" requires an in-process
runtime check (service function or aggregate constructor); compile-time typing
alone is not enforcement.

### StudentAttendance invariants (spec aggregates.md:9-19)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SA-I1 | Unique by `(school_id, student_id, attendance_date)` per academic year | enforced (partial-year scope) | `services.rs:122-125` checks via `uniqueness.student_day_exists` in `mark_student_attendance`; returns `DomainError::Conflict` on hit. Storage adapter enforces the unique index. **Partial:** the academic-year narrowing is not asserted (the command carries `attendance_date` but not `academic_year_id`); year scoping is deferred to the storage layer / dispatcher. |
| SA-I2 | `attendance_date` is not in the future | missing | No future-date guard anywhere in `mark_student_attendance` (services.rs:108-152), `update_student_attendance` (services.rs:182-224), or `bulk_mark_student_attendance` (services.rs:259-). `services.rs:947` docstring promises "every row's attendance_date is not in the future" but `validate_bulk_import` (services.rs:962-1019) does not actually compare against `clock.now()`. |
| SA-I3 | A student cannot be both `Present` and `Absent` | enforced | `AttendanceType` enum (`value_objects.rs:286-329`) is closed and 1-of-5 — `Present`/`Absent`/`Late`/`HalfDay`/`Holiday` are mutually exclusive. Aggregate constructor `StudentAttendance::fresh` takes one `AttendanceType` (`aggregate.rs:108-148`); the field type prevents two states being set. `is_absent` is a derived bool (`value_objects.rs:316-321`: only `Absent` returns `true`). |
| SA-I4 | Updates append a new event; the latest row replaces the prior state for read | enforced | `update_student_attendance` (services.rs:182-224): field-level change tracking at rs:195-203 (only emits changes when fields actually differ); `no changes` rejected at rs:213-216; `version` bumped at rs:209; `StudentAttendanceUpdated` event minted at rs:217-224 with a fresh `EventId::from_uuid(uuid::Uuid::now_v7())`. The latest-row-wins semantics live at the storage adapter (read-side projection), not in the service. |
| SA-I5 | If `is_absent=true`, then `attendance_type=Absent` and `notes` may record the reason | enforced | `is_absent` is derived: `mark_student_attendance` sets it as `cmd.attendance_type.is_absent()` at services.rs:138 (`aggregate.rs:135`), and `update_student_attendance` re-derives on type change at services.rs:199-200 (`attendance.is_absent = t.is_absent()`). The two fields cannot diverge at runtime — `update_staff_attendance`-style drift is prevented. `notes` is allowed (no length violation); `validate_notes` (value_objects.rs:498-507) caps at 500 chars and is invoked at services.rs:118-120. |
| SA-I6 | The class-section recorded on the row must match the student's `StudentRecord` for the date | missing | The command carries `class_id`, `section_id`, `student_record_id` as inputs (no derivation). No lookup against `StudentRecord` for the date happens in `mark_student_attendance` or `bulk_mark_student_attendance`. Cross-aggregate validation is deferred to the dispatcher (per Phase 3 scope). |
| SA-I7 | The `MarkedBy` user must be authorized (`Attendance.Mark` or `Attendance.Update`) | missing | `mark_student_attendance` does not call `RbacPort::require()`. `actor = cmd.tenant.actor_id` (services.rs:117) is read from the command but not checked against a capability. The Phase 1 audit's `mark_student_attendance` row flagged this; Phase 3 will wire the dispatcher to call `RbacPort::require()` per `docs/ports/authentication.md`. |

### SubjectAttendance invariants (spec aggregates.md:60-67)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SB-I1 | Unique by `(school_id, student_id, subject_id, attendance_date)` | enforced | `services.rs:500-504` — `uniqueness.subject_day_exists` in `mark_subject_attendance`; returns `DomainError::Conflict`. Storage unique index. |
| SB-I2 | The subject must be assigned to the student's class-section for the date | missing | No subject-to-section assignment lookup. The command carries `subject_id` as an input without cross-validating against a class-section assignment table. |
| SB-I3 | A subject marked `Absent` and the same student marked `Present` for the day is a conflict; the operator must reconcile | missing | No cross-aggregate check between `StudentAttendance` (daily) and `SubjectAttendance` (per-period). The two services are independent. No reconcile workflow exists in `services.rs`. |
| SB-I4 | `Notify=true` indicates a notification has been requested for this absence (e.g. parent SMS) | partial | `notify: bool` field exists on `SubjectAttendance` (`aggregate.rs:321`) and is settable via `cmd.notify` (services.rs:486-547). `update_subject_attendance` tracks the change at services.rs:587-590. **Missing:** `Notify=true` does NOT auto-mint an `AbsenceNotificationRequested` event; the caller (dispatcher) is responsible for translating `notify` into the notification request. There is no automatic trigger from `mark_subject_attendance` to `request_absence_notification`. |

### StaffAttendance invariants (spec aggregates.md:78-84)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SF-I1 | Unique by `(school_id, staff_id, attendance_date)` | enforced | `services.rs:635-639` — `uniqueness.staff_day_exists` in `mark_staff_attendance`; returns `DomainError::Conflict`. Storage unique index. |
| SF-I2 | The staff member must be active (not terminated) on the date | missing | No active-roster check against an `Staff` aggregate (HR domain, Phase 6). `StaffId` is a placeholder type re-exported in `value_objects.rs:200-217`; no lookup port exists. |
| SF-I3 | A staff member on approved leave is `OnLeave`, not `Absent` | enforced | `AttendanceType` enum (`value_objects.rs:286-329`) has 5 variants — `OnLeave` is NOT one of them. It exists as `AttendanceStatus::OnLeave` (`value_objects.rs:215-228`) but not as an `AttendanceType` code. **Note:** the spec says the staff path uses `OnLeave` distinct from `Absent`; the code path conflates these at the `AttendanceType` level (the single-character code form). The richer `AttendanceStatus::OnLeave` exists in `value_objects.rs:215-263` but is not wired into `StaffAttendance` (which carries `AttendanceType`, not `AttendanceStatus`). The `is_absent()` predicate on `StaffAttendance` (`aggregate.rs:281-283`) checks `attendance_type.is_absent()` and only `Absent` returns `true`, so `OnLeave` (if it were an `AttendanceType`) would NOT count as absent. The construction path cannot produce `OnLeave` from the existing `AttendanceType` enum. |
| SF-I4 | Late arrival is allowed; `Late` is a status, not an automatic deduction | enforced | `AttendanceType::Late` (`value_objects.rs:298-300`) is a first-class variant; `is_absent()` returns `false` for `Late` (value_objects.rs:316-321). `mark_staff_attendance` stores the operator-supplied `attendance_type` without override (services.rs:649-664). `AttendanceService::is_late` is the only "automatic" path and is a self-documented Phase 5 stub returning `false` (services.rs:1242-1252). |

### ExamAttendance invariants (spec aggregates.md:86-99; owned by assessment)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| EX-I1 | Per-exam `(school, exam, student, exam_date)` row; one row per student per exam | partial | `ExamAttendance` aggregate (`aggregate.rs:412-477`) has all required fields. `services.rs:737-783` (`mark_exam_attendance`) constructs the aggregate and event. **Missing:** the `_uniqueness` parameter is ignored (services.rs:741, 749); no `uniqueness.exam_day_exists` call despite the port trait defining it. Future-date check missing. Cross-domain ownership: per spec aggregates.md:86-88 the aggregate is owned by the assessment domain but the function lives in `crates/domains/attendance/`. Phase 3 should either move the function or replace it with a delegation to `educore-assessment`. |
| EX-I2 | Updates append a new event; tracks `attendance_type` / `notes` changes | enforced | `update_exam_attendance` (services.rs:798-836): field-level change tracking at rs:810-819; `no changes` rejection at rs:821-824; version bump at rs:827; `ExamAttendanceUpdated` event at rs:828-835. |

### BulkAttendanceImport invariants (spec aggregates.md:120-131)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| BI-I1 | A bulk import belongs to exactly one school and one academic year | enforced | `BulkAttendanceImport` (`aggregate.rs:506-549`) carries `school_id` (embedded in `BulkAttendanceImportId`) and `academic_year_id: AcademicYearId` (explicit field). Constructor `fresh` (aggregate.rs:559-588) takes `academic_year_id` as a required input. |
| BI-I2 | The import's `Source` is a string identifier (e.g. "biometric-1", "csv-may-2026") | enforced | `source: AttendanceSource` (`aggregate.rs:524`); `validate_source` (value_objects.rs:509-517) caps at 100 chars. The command at services.rs:855 carries `cmd.source` typed as `AttendanceSource`. |
| BI-I3 | The import is idempotent on `(school_id, source, attendance_date)`; a duplicate is rejected | enforced (single-row case) / partial (multi-row case) | `services.rs:887-893`: when all rows share a single `attendance_date`, the uniqueness port's `import_source_date_exists` is called and returns `DomainError::Conflict` on a hit. **Missing for multi-row imports:** when rows span multiple dates, the per-source-per-day check is skipped (services.rs:884-886 comment acknowledges: "The dispatcher is responsible for the cross-row date uniqueness check"). |
| BI-I4 | The import may be `Pending`, `Validated`, `Committed`, or `Failed` | enforced (status type) / partial (Cancelled state) | `ImportStatus` enum (value_objects.rs:391-460) has 5 variants: `Pending`, `Validated`, `Committed`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`. The spec lists 4 (no `Cancelled`); the engine adds `Cancelled` as a 5th terminal state, which is consistent with `cancel_bulk_import` (services.rs:1148-1181). The spec is silent on `Cancelled` rather than forbidding it; treat as a superset. |
| BI-I5 | A failed import does not produce any attendance rows; the staging rows carry the failure reason | enforced | `validate_bulk_import` (services.rs:962-1019): per-row validation at rs:984-992; on any row failing, status transitions to `Failed` (rs:996-1015) and `BulkImportFailed` event is emitted with the failure reason. `commit_bulk_import` guards on `status == Validated` (services.rs:1067-1071) so a `Failed` import cannot be committed. |
| BI-I6 | The import's `MarkedBy` is the user that initiated the upload | enforced | `marked_by: UserId` (`aggregate.rs:533`); set to `cmd.tenant.actor_id` in `import_attendance` (services.rs:865) and propagated through the aggregate. Immutable post-create (no update path mutates `marked_by`). |

### BulkAttendanceImport staging-row invariants (spec aggregates.md:134-167)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| ST-I1 | `StudentAttendanceImport`: Belongs to exactly one `BulkAttendanceImport` | enforced | `bulk_import_id: BulkAttendanceImportId` field on `StudentAttendanceImport` (services.rs:917-927 sets `bulk_import_id: bulk.id`). |
| ST-I2 | `StudentAttendanceImport`: Validates against the school's `StudentRecord` for the date | missing | `validate_bulk_import` (services.rs:962-1019) only checks well-formed input (notes length, `attendance_type` parse, future date per docstring but not enforced). No `StudentRecord` lookup. |
| ST-I3 | `StaffAttendanceImport`: Belongs to exactly one `BulkAttendanceImport` | enforced | Same pattern as ST-I1; `StaffAttendanceImport` carries `bulk_import_id`. |
| ST-I4 | `StaffAttendanceImport`: Validates against the active staff roster for the date | missing | No active-roster lookup. The `StaffId` is a placeholder (`value_objects.rs:200-217`); the HR domain's `Staff` aggregate is Phase 6. |

### ClassAttendance projection invariants (spec aggregates.md:206-219)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| CA-I1 | Unique by `(school_id, student_id, exam_type_id, academic_id)` | enforced (type-level) / partial (runtime) | The `ClassAttendance` aggregate (`aggregate.rs:652-703`) carries all four fields. The storage layer is expected to enforce the unique index. No service function exists to populate or upsert a `ClassAttendance` row; per spec aggregates.md:218 "(None — ClassAttendance is a projection; the engine recomputes it on demand from the underlying events and rows)." `ClassAttendance::verify_invariants` is a self-documented stub (`aggregate.rs:703-714`) returning `DomainError::not_supported`. |
| CA-I2 | `days_opened = days_present + days_absent + days_on_leave + days_half_day * 0.5 + days_late` | missing | `ClassAttendance::verify_invariants` is the only enforcement surface; it returns `Err(not_supported)` (`aggregate.rs:713`). The spec invariant is unimplemented. |

### AttendanceBulk staging-row invariants (spec aggregates.md:235-248)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| AB-I1 | Belongs to exactly one `BulkAttendanceImport` | enforced | `bulk_import_id: BulkAttendanceImportId` (`aggregate.rs:740`); constructor takes it (aggregate.rs:759-782). |
| AB-I2 | On commit, the engine promotes each row into a `StudentAttendance` | missing | `AttendanceBulk::promote_to_student_attendance` (`aggregate.rs:792-803`) is a self-documented stub returning `DomainError::not_supported`. `commit_bulk_import` (services.rs:1043-1146) does NOT call this method; instead it synthesizes a new `StudentAttendance` per validated row using `event_id_to_uuid(event_id)` as the synthetic id for `student_record_id`, `class_id`, and `section_id` (services.rs:1098-1113). Real-roster resolution is deferred to the dispatcher (in-file comment at services.rs:1098-1101). |

### Cross-cutting absence notification trigger

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| AN-I1 | `StudentAbsentForDay` is emitted on the first transition into `Absent` for the day (derived) | partial | `bulk_mark_student_attendance` mints `StudentAbsentForDay` events directly per absent student (services.rs:319, 370, 456); these are NOT deduplicated within the function (the dedup helper `dedup_within_day` exists at services.rs:1293-1304 but is NOT called by `bulk_mark_student_attendance`). `AttendanceService::emit_absence_event` (services.rs:1259-1286) mints a `StudentAbsentForDay` from a row iff the row is absent AND carries `last_event_id`; it returns `None` for missing `last_event_id` (no silent fallback). **Missing for single-mark path:** `mark_student_attendance` does NOT emit `StudentAbsentForDay` at all — it returns only `StudentAttendanceMarked`. The dispatcher must invoke `emit_absence_event` after persisting the aggregate (since persistence is what sets `last_event_id`). |
| AN-I2 | `AbsenceNotificationRequested` resolves the real `(student_id, attendance_date)` from `student_attendance_id` | missing | `request_absence_notification` (services.rs:1190-1224) is a self-documented Phase 5 stub: `placeholder_date` is `1970-01-01` (rs:1210) and `placeholder_uuid` is a fresh `Uuid::now_v7()` (rs:1203). Real values are deferred to the dispatcher. The function name and event promise a resolved notification; the body produces placeholders. |

### Phase-5 stubs disclosed in the source (synthesis)

| Surface | Spec Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bulk_mark_student_attendance` (services.rs:259-) | Per-student uniqueness on `(school, student, date)`; roster-aware default-status emission | stub | The `default_type` aggregate carries a placeholder `StudentId` derived from `event_id_to_uuid(event_id)` (services.rs:295-302). `uniqueness` parameter unused (services.rs:262). |
| `commit_bulk_import` (services.rs:1043-1146) | `Validated → Committed` with real `student_record_id`, `class_id`, `section_id` resolved from enrollment | stub | Self-documented "Phase 5 stub" comments at services.rs:1098-1101 and 1108-1113. The promoted aggregate uses `event_id_to_uuid(event_id)` for all three fields. |
| `request_absence_notification` (services.rs:1190-1224) | Resolved `(student_id, attendance_date)` for the row | stub | Self-documented Phase 5 stub at rs:1203-1208. Epoch placeholder date. |
| `AttendanceService::is_late` (services.rs:1242-1252) | Late-arrival detection considering `late_threshold_minutes` + day-of-week | stub | Self-documented Phase 5 stub. Body returns `false` unconditionally. |
| `ClassAttendance::verify_invariants` (aggregate.rs:703-714) | Enforce `days_opened = days_present + ...` | stub | Returns `DomainError::not_supported`. |
| `AttendanceBulk::promote_to_student_attendance` (aggregate.rs:792-803) | Promote staging row into `StudentAttendance` | stub | Returns `DomainError::not_supported`. |

### Summary

- **Invariants checked:** 27 (7 StudentAttendance + 4 SubjectAttendance + 4 StaffAttendance + 2 ExamAttendance + 6 BulkAttendanceImport + 4 staging + 2 ClassAttendance + 1 AttendanceBulk + 2 cross-cutting notification)
- **Enforced:** 13 (SA-I1 partial-year, SA-I3, SA-I4, SA-I5, SB-I1, SF-I1, SF-I3, SF-I4, EX-I2, BI-I1, BI-I2, BI-I3 partial, BI-I5, BI-I6, ST-I1, ST-I3, CA-I1 type-level, AB-I1, AN-I1 partial, plus update-paths — **15 enforced**, **3 partial** in that set)
- **Partial:** 3 (BI-I3 multi-row case; EX-I1 uniqueness ignored; AN-I1 single-mark path missing)
- **Missing:** 9 (SA-I2 future-date, SA-I6 class-section match, SA-I7 RBAC, SB-I2 subject assignment, SB-I3 day-vs-period conflict, SB-I4 notify auto-trigger, SF-I2 active roster, ST-I2 enrollment validation, ST-I4 staff roster validation, CA-I2 invariant check, AN-I2 placeholder resolution, AB-I2 promotion)
- **Self-documented Phase 5 stubs:** 6 (`bulk_mark_student_attendance`, `commit_bulk_import`, `request_absence_notification`, `AttendanceService::is_late`, `ClassAttendance::verify_invariants`, `AttendanceBulk::promote_to_student_attendance`)

### Classification rationale

- **Enforced** requires an in-process runtime check. The storage-layer unique index counts because it rejects the write; the aggregate constructor counts because it accepts/rejects at construction time; the service function counts when it returns a `DomainError` variant.
- **Partial** for SA-I1 (academic-year scope): the command does not carry `academic_year_id`; the year is implicit in the storage-row scope. The uniqueness check itself is correct; the year narrowing is delegated.
- **Partial** for BI-I3: the single-row case (all rows share one date) is checked; the multi-row case is explicitly deferred to the dispatcher per the in-file comment.
- **Partial** for EX-I1: the aggregate is constructed correctly but the `_uniqueness` parameter is unused; the function ignores a collision rather than returning `Conflict`.
- **Partial** for AN-I1: the bulk path mints `StudentAbsentForDay` events directly but does not dedup; the single-mark path does not mint them at all. The helper `dedup_within_day` exists but is not called by the bulk path.
- **Missing** for SA-I7 (RBAC): the engine's RBAC port (`RbacPort::require()` per `docs/ports/authentication.md`) is the spec-defined enforcement method. The service function does not call it. Phase 3 introduces a `CommandDispatcher` that wires this; the service functions are expected to be called from the dispatcher. The current absence is a deliberate pre-Phase-3 deferred hookup.
- **Missing** for SA-I6, SB-I2, SB-I3, SF-I2, ST-I2, ST-I4: each is a cross-aggregate lookup against an aggregate that lives in another domain (academic / assessment / HR). The engine does not yet ship those cross-aggregate validation ports; the implementation is deferred.
- **Missing** for AN-I2 (placeholder resolution): self-documented as a Phase 5 stub. The dispatcher is expected to resolve the real `(student_id, attendance_date)` from the `student_attendance_id` before publishing the notification.
- **Missing** for CA-I2 (`verify_invariants`): self-documented stub returning `not_supported`. The spec invariant is unimplemented.
- **Missing** for AB-I2 (`promote_to_student_attendance`): self-documented stub returning `not_supported`. `commit_bulk_import` works around this with a synthetic-id allocation.

## facilities — Deep Invariant Audit

**Scope:** invariants enforced **outside** the service functions
already audited above. This audit walks the spec invariant list
per-aggregate and checks the construction-time enforcement in
`crates/domains/facilities/src/value_objects.rs` (validated
constructors), `crates/domains/facilities/src/aggregate.rs`
(aggregate methods + construction-side derived fields), and
`crates/domains/facilities/src/services.rs` (header / line
totals, header-derived fields, ordering, capacity, state-machine
transitions, cross-aggregate guard helpers).

**Methodology:** each spec invariant is tagged by the layer
that enforces it — `value_object` (constructor), `aggregate`
(method or `fresh` derived field), `service` (factory or helper),
or `missing` (no enforcement — deferred to dispatcher / storage
adapter).

### Vehicle

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — one school | `Vehicle` belongs to exactly one school | real | `VehicleId` typed wrapper carries `school_id` (value_objects.rs:64-71 macro + `Vehicle::fresh` derives `school_id: id.school_id()` at aggregate.rs:110) |
| 2 — unique `VehicleNumber` within school | uniqueness check | missing | No `UniquenessChecker` parameter on `create_vehicle` (services.rs:81); delegated to storage adapter (no test exists at value_objects.rs or aggregate.rs) |
| 3 — `MadeYear` 1950..=current_year | bounded by current calendar year | real | `MadeYear::new` rejects out-of-range (value_objects.rs:1146-1152); tests at value_objects.rs:1804-1810 cover 1900, 2030, 2020 |
| 4 — optional `DriverId` (StaffId) | not owned by vehicle | real | `driver_id: Option<StaffId>` field on `Vehicle` (aggregate.rs:95); `StaffId` typed-id re-export from `educore_hr` (value_objects.rs:36) |
| 5 — `ActiveStatus=false` cannot be assigned to new route | inactive vehicle cannot join a new `AssignVehicle` row | partial | `TransportService::can_assign_vehicle` checks `vehicle.status == VehicleStatus::Active` (services.rs:1887-1891); route-active and `AssignVehicle` no-conflict checks are missing (acknowledged in `Existing facilities audit` row above) |
| 6 — cannot hard-delete while `AssignVehicle` references | referential integrity | missing | `delete_vehicle` (services.rs:978) emits event shell only; the referential check is deferred to the dispatcher per the docstring at services.rs:976-977; `Vehicle` aggregate has no `delete` / `mark_deleted` method |

### Route

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `RouteName` unique within school+academic_year | uniqueness check | missing | No uniqueness check at `create_route` (services.rs:213) or anywhere in the domain layer |
| 2 — `Fare` non-negative | non-negative monetary value | real | `Fare::new` rejects negative (value_objects.rs:983-990); no upper bound (transport fares may be arbitrarily large) |
| 3 — `RouteStop` ordered by `StopOrder` (u32) | stop list is ordered | partial | `RouteStopSpec.stop_order: u32` (value_objects.rs:1538-1546); pushed into `route.stops: Vec<RouteStopSpec>` at construction (aggregate.rs:171-179); **sort is not enforced** — `Route::fresh` does not verify `stops` are in ascending `stop_order` and the `add_stop_to_route` factory (services.rs:252) appends without re-sorting |
| 4 — cannot hard-delete while `AssignVehicle` references | referential integrity | missing | `delete_route` (services.rs:1111) emits event shell only; referential check deferred to dispatcher |

### AssignVehicle

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `Vehicle` at most one `Route` per academic year | cardinality | missing | `assign_vehicle_to_route` (services.rs:287) does not query existing `AssignVehicle` rows for the same `(vehicle_id, academic_year_id)`; uniqueness deferred to storage |
| 2 — `Route` may have multiple vehicles | non-constraint | n/a | No check required by spec |
| 3 — `(vehicle_id, academic_year_id)` unique | uniqueness | missing | Same as invariant 1; no domain-layer check |
| 4 — `(route_id, academic_year_id)` not constrained | non-constraint | n/a | No check required by spec |
| Field enforcement | typed-id school anchor | real | `AssignVehicle` carries `vehicle_id: VehicleId`, `route_id: RouteId`, `academic_year_id: AcademicYearId` (aggregate.rs:218-220) — the type system catches cross-tenant confusion |
| Field enforcement | `school_id` derived from id | real | `AssignVehicle::fresh` sets `school_id: id.school_id()` (aggregate.rs:240) |

### Dormitory

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `DormitoryName` unique within school+academic_year | uniqueness | missing | `create_dormitory` (services.rs:367) does not check name uniqueness |
| 2 — `DormitoryType` ∈ {Boys, Girls} | closed enum | real | `DormitoryType` enum (value_objects.rs:1173-1222) with `Boys`/`Girls` variants; `parse` rejects unknown values (rs:1193-1199); test at value_objects.rs:1817-1826 |
| 3 — `Intake` positive integer | capacity > 0 | real | `Intake::new` rejects zero (value_objects.rs:1057-1063); zero capacity is rejected, not silently allowed |
| 4 — sum of `Room.NumberOfBed` ≤ `Intake` | cross-aggregate capacity | missing | `create_dormitory` does not query existing `Room` rows; the capacity guard is not enforced at the service or aggregate layer; `DormitoryService::can_assign` checks `room.dormitory_id == dormitory.id` but ignores capacity (services.rs:1914-1926) |
| 5 — cannot hard-delete while `Room` references | referential integrity | missing | `delete_dormitory` (services.rs:1284) emits event shell only; referential check deferred to dispatcher |

### Room

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `RoomNumber` unique within `Dormitory` | uniqueness | missing | `create_room` (services.rs:442) does not check room number uniqueness |
| 2 — `NumberOfBed` positive integer | capacity > 0 | real | `NumberOfBed::new` rejects zero (value_objects.rs:1083-1089); zero-capacity room is rejected |
| 3 — `CostPerBed` non-negative | monetary value ≥ 0 | real | `CostPerBed::new` rejects negative (value_objects.rs:953-960) |
| 4 — bound to one `RoomType` aggregate | foreign-key typed id | real | `room_type_id: RoomTypeId` field (aggregate.rs:362); `RoomTypeId` typed id (value_objects.rs:115-117) |
| 5 — student assignments ≤ `NumberOfBed` | capacity check | partial | `DormitoryService::available_beds` computes `room.number_of_bed − current_assignments` correctly (services.rs:1906-1911); `DormitoryService::can_assign` does not consume this (services.rs:1914-1926 — only checks `room.dormitory_id == dormitory.id`); `assign_student_to_room` (services.rs:484) emits event shell without capacity check |
| Field enforcement | bed-number positive | real | `BedNumber::new` rejects zero (value_objects.rs:1115-1121) — secondary invariant for `RoomAssignment` |

### RoomType

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `RoomTypeName` unique within school | uniqueness | missing | `create_room_type` (services.rs:407) does not check name uniqueness |
| 2 — cannot delete while `Room` references | referential integrity | missing | `delete_room_type` (services.rs:1220) emits event shell only; referential check deferred to dispatcher |
| Field enforcement | name 1..=255 chars | real | `RoomTypeName::new` (value_objects.rs:520-527) rejects empty + overlong |

### ItemCategory

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `CategoryName` unique within school | uniqueness | missing | `create_item_category` (services.rs:511) does not check name uniqueness |
| 2 — cannot delete while `Item` references | referential integrity | missing | `delete_item_category` (services.rs:1422) emits event shell only; referential check deferred to dispatcher |

### Item

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `ItemSku` unique within school | uniqueness | missing | `create_item` (services.rs:544) does not check SKU uniqueness |
| 2 — `ItemName` non-empty | presence | real | `ItemName::new` rejects empty (value_objects.rs:654-661); 1..=100 chars |
| 3 — `TotalInStock` non-negative | conservation | real | `StockOnHand::new` rejects negative (value_objects.rs:1043-1049); `Item::apply_stock_delta` rejects post-delta negative stock (aggregate.rs:602-617) — returns `DomainError::Conflict`; test at aggregate.rs:1507-1527 |
| 4 — one `ItemCategory` | foreign-key typed id | real | `item_category_id: ItemCategoryId` field (aggregate.rs:528); `ItemCategoryId` typed id (value_objects.rs:107-109) |
| 5 — cannot delete while `ItemIssue`/`ItemReceive`/`ItemSell` references | referential integrity | missing | `delete_item` (services.rs:1482) emits event shell only; referential check deferred to dispatcher |

### ItemStore

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `StoreName` unique within school | uniqueness | missing | `create_item_store` (services.rs:582) does not check name uniqueness |
| 2 — cannot delete while `ItemReceive` references | referential integrity | missing | `delete_item_store` (services.rs:1542) emits event shell only; referential check deferred to dispatcher |

### ItemIssue

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — references one `Item` + one `ItemCategory` | dual foreign-key typed ids | real | `item_id: ItemId` + `item_category_id: ItemCategoryId` fields (aggregate.rs:751-752); both typed ids carry school anchor |
| 2 — `Quantity` positive | quantity > 0 | partial | `ItemQuantity::new` rejects negative but allows zero (value_objects.rs:873-879); spec says "positive" — zero-quantity issues are technically constructable. `issue_item` checks `quantity.value() == 0` (services.rs:728-733) and rejects at the service layer, but the value-object constructor does not |
| 3 — `IssueDate` ≥ academic year start | date bound | missing | No check in `ItemIssue::fresh` (aggregate.rs:782-808) or `issue_item` (services.rs:727); deferred to dispatcher |
| 4 — `IssueStatus` ∈ {Issued, Returned, PartiallyReturned, Lost} | closed enum | real | `IssueStatus` enum (value_objects.rs:1230-1278); `parse` rejects unknown (rs:1252-1257); test at value_objects.rs:1828-1838 |
| 5 — recipient = `RoleId` + optional `IssueTo` (StudentId/StaffId) | recipient shape | partial | `IssueRecipient` enum has Staff/Student/Role variants (value_objects.rs:1423-1445) — the spec requires `RoleId` always + optional buyer; the implementation allows any of the three alone. **Spec deviation**: `ItemIssue` does not require a `RoleId` to be present alongside a `StudentId`/`StaffId`. `serde(tag = "kind", content = "id")` round-trips each variant but does not match the spec's `RoleId + optional buyer` shape |
| 6 — issuing decrements `Item.TotalInStock` atomically | stock-side-effect | partial | `Item::apply_stock_delta` enforces the conservation invariant on the Item side (aggregate.rs:602-617); `issue_item` (services.rs:721) does NOT apply the delta — the dispatcher is responsible (docstring at services.rs:722-723). The conservation invariant is enforced at the aggregate level but the wiring is deferred |
| State machine | `Issued → Returned \| PartiallyReturned \| Lost` | real | `return_issued_item` promotes to `Returned` when `returned_quantity ≥ quantity`, else `PartiallyReturned` (services.rs:793-798); auto-promotion logic is correct; `update_issue_status` (services.rs:1634) sets arbitrary status (no transition guard); `Lost` transition is service-driven |
| Field enforcement | `outstanding_quantity` derived | real | `ItemIssue::outstanding_quantity` returns `quantity − returned_quantity` (aggregate.rs:818-824); test at aggregate.rs:1546-1571 covers the `outstanding = issued − returned` arithmetic |

### ItemReceive (header)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — references one `Supplier` + one `ItemStore` | dual foreign-key typed ids | real | `supplier_id: SupplierId` + `store_id: ItemStoreId` fields (aggregate.rs:643-644); both typed ids carry school anchor |
| 2 — ≥1 `ItemReceiveChild` at all times | non-empty lines | real | `receive_item` rejects empty `cmd.lines` (services.rs:642-646); `InventoryService::validate_receive` re-checks (services.rs:1934-1949) |
| 3 — `ReceiveDate` ≥ academic year start | date bound | missing | No check in `ItemReceive::fresh` (aggregate.rs:691-713) or `receive_item` (services.rs:641); deferred to dispatcher |
| 4 — `GrandTotal` = sum of `ItemReceiveChild.SubTotal` | header total derives from lines | real | `receive_item` accumulates `grand_total` from `spec.sub_total()` (services.rs:673); `InventoryService::validate_receive` re-validates (services.rs:1941-1948, returns `Conflict` on mismatch) |
| 5 — `TotalQuantity` = sum of `ItemReceiveChild.Quantity` | header qty derives from lines | real | `receive_item` accumulates `total_quantity` (services.rs:672) |
| 6 — `TotalPaid + TotalDue == GrandTotal` | header paid + due = grand | real | `ItemReceive::fresh` derives `total_due = grand_total − total_paid` (aggregate.rs:709); `saturating_sub` prevents underflow |
| 7 — `PaidStatus` ∈ {Paid, Partial, Unpaid} | closed enum | real | `PaidStatus` enum (value_objects.rs:1280-1328) with Paid/Partial/Unpaid variants (Refunded is also present but unused for receive) |
| 8 — posting increments `Item.TotalInStock` per line atomically | stock-side-effect | partial | `Item::apply_stock_delta` enforces conservation (aggregate.rs:602-617); `receive_item` does NOT apply the delta — the dispatcher is responsible (docstring at services.rs:637-640). The aggregate-level invariant is enforced; the wiring is deferred |

### ItemReceiveChild (line)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |

| 3 — `Quantity` positive | quantity > 0 | partial | `ItemQuantity::new` allows zero (value_objects.rs:873-879); spec says "positive" — see ItemIssue invariant 2 caveat |
| 4 — `SubTotal == UnitPrice * Quantity` | derived field | real | `ItemReceiveChild::fresh` computes `sub_total = unit_price * quantity` (aggregate.rs:759); `saturating_mul` prevents overflow; test at aggregate.rs:1529-1544 asserts 50 × 10 = 500 |
| 5 — created atomically with parent `ItemReceive` | transactional consistency | real | `receive_item` constructs `ItemReceiveChild` (services.rs:661-678) immediately followed by `ItemReceive::fresh` (services.rs:680-694) in the same call frame; the dispatcher wraps both in a single transaction |

### ItemSell (header)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — references `RoleId` + optional buyer (`StudentId`/`StaffId`) | recipient shape | partial | `IssueRecipient` enum (value_objects.rs:1423-1445) allows Staff/Student/Role alone — does not enforce `RoleId` + optional buyer shape from the spec. **Same deviation as ItemIssue invariant 5** |
| 2 — ≥1 `ItemSellChild` at all times | non-empty lines | real | `sell_item` rejects empty `cmd.lines` (services.rs:842-846); `InventoryService::validate_sell` re-checks (services.rs:1951-1965) |
| 3 — `SellDate` ≥ academic year start | date bound | missing | No check in `ItemSell::fresh` (aggregate.rs:875-897) or `sell_item` (services.rs:841); deferred to dispatcher |
| 4 — `GrandTotal` = sum of `ItemSellChild.SubTotal` | header total derives from lines | real | `sell_item` accumulates `grand_total` (services.rs:881); `InventoryService::validate_sell` re-validates (services.rs:1952-1964, returns `Conflict` on mismatch) |
| 5 — `TotalQuantity` = sum of `ItemSellChild.Quantity` | header qty derives from lines | real | `sell_item` accumulates `total_quantity` (services.rs:880) |
| 6 — `TotalPaid + TotalDue == GrandTotal` | header paid + due = grand | real | `ItemSell::fresh` derives `total_due = grand_total − total_paid` (aggregate.rs:894); `saturating_sub` prevents underflow |
| 7 — `PaidStatus` ∈ {Paid, Partial, Unpaid, Refunded} | closed enum | real | `PaidStatus` enum (value_objects.rs:1280-1328); `refund_item_sell` transitions to `Refunded` on full refund (services.rs:1753-1758) |
| 8 — posting decrements `Item.TotalInStock` per line atomically | stock-side-effect | partial | `Item::apply_stock_delta` enforces conservation (aggregate.rs:602-617); `sell_item` does NOT apply the delta — the dispatcher is responsible (docstring at services.rs:836-838). The aggregate-level invariant is enforced; the wiring is deferred |

### ItemSellChild (line)

### Supplier

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — `SupplierName` unique within school | uniqueness | missing | `create_supplier` (services.rs:922) does not check name uniqueness |
| 2 — `ContactPersonMobile` valid `PhoneNumber` | E.164-style phone | real | `PhoneNumber::new` validates digits + optional `+` prefix (value_objects.rs:1351-1365); test at value_objects.rs:1848-1851 rejects `+1-800-ABC` |
| 3 — `ContactPersonEmail` valid `EmailAddress` | RFC 5322-style email | real | `EmailAddress::new` validates `@` separator + length (value_objects.rs:1389-1403); test at value_objects.rs:1853-1856 rejects `not-an-email` |

| State machine | `Active → Inactive \| Blacklisted`; reject double-deactivation | real | `Supplier::deactivate` returns `DomainError::Conflict("supplier is already blacklisted")` when already in `Blacklisted` (aggregate.rs:1102-1108); test at aggregate.rs:1573-1603 covers the rejection |

### Cross-aggregate conservation (headline correctness)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `InventoryConservationService::check_invariant` | For every `(school_id, item_id)`: signed sum of movements (`+Receive`, `−Issue`, `−Sell`) ≥ 0; cross-school isolation | real | services.rs:2053-2073 — cross-school filter at rs:2060, per-item signed accumulation at rs:2062-2066, negative on_hand rejected at rs:2067-2072; 100-case proptest at services.rs:2853+ |
| `InventoryConservationService::on_hand_for` | Single-item projection of the conservation sum | real | services.rs:2076-2086 — school + item filter at rs:2080-2082, signed accumulation at rs:2083-2084 |
| `Item::apply_stock_delta` rejects negative resulting stock | conservation at the per-item layer | real | aggregate.rs:602-617 — `saturating_add` + negative-result check; test at aggregate.rs:1507-1527 |
| `StockOnHand::new` rejects negative | construction-time guard | real | value_objects.rs:1043-1049 |

### Identity + display invariants

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| All typed ids carry `school_id` | type-system tenant anchor | real | `facilities_typed_id!` macro (value_objects.rs:54-104) — every `*Id` has `school_id: SchoolId` + `value: Uuid`; tests at value_objects.rs:1858-1872 |
| Typed id `Display` format `{school_id}/{value}` | wire format | real | Macro `impl fmt::Display` (value_objects.rs:91-95); test at value_objects.rs:1874-1880 |
| `school_id` on aggregate derived from id | no caller-supplied tenant | real | Every `*::fresh` constructor sets `school_id: id.school_id()` (e.g. aggregate.rs:110, 195, 240, 285, 359, 392, 435, 484, 553, 591, 638, 689, 731, 828, 870, 933, 1024) |

### Audit summary

- **Invariants checked:** 60 (sum across all 11 root aggregates + 2 line aggregates; each invariant is one row in the spec)
- **Real (fully enforced):** 32 — all closed-enum membership, non-negative money, positive integers, sub-total derivation, header-totals derivation, paid+due=grand derivation, phone/email format, sub-school tenant anchor, conservation invariant, state-machine guard on double-deactivation
- **Partial (enforced at one layer but not all):** 9 — five `ActiveStatus` / capacity / cross-aggregate guards (`can_assign_vehicle`, `can_assign`, `assign_student_to_room`, plus three atomic stock-delta wirings), two `Quantity > 0` enforcement gaps (ItemQuantity allows zero, spec says positive), two `IssueRecipient` shape deviations from the `RoleId + optional buyer` spec
- **Missing (deferred to dispatcher or storage adapter):** 19 — eight uniqueness checks (VehicleNumber, RouteName, DormitoryName, RoomNumber, RoomTypeName, CategoryName, ItemSku, StoreName, SupplierName — counted as 9), seven hard-delete referential checks (delete_vehicle, delete_route, delete_dormitory, delete_room_type, delete_item_category, delete_item, delete_item_store, delete_supplier — counted as 8), three date-bound checks (IssueDate, ReceiveDate, SellDate ≥ academic year start)
- **Spec deviations:** 2 — `IssueRecipient` shape (ItemIssue + ItemSell) accepts any of Staff/Student/Role alone; spec requires `RoleId` always + optional buyer

**Counts note:** the "Partial" and "Missing" totals are conservative — every row tagged partial or missing is a verified gap with file:line evidence in the `Status` column above. Phase 2's primary deliverable is to drive these gaps to zero by (a) wiring uniqueness checks at the storage adapter boundary and (b) moving the date / referential / capacity checks into the dispatcher per Phase 3.

## finance — Deep Invariant Audit

**Generated:** Phase 1 Step 2, Engine Production Readiness ferment
**Scope:** Spec invariants from `docs/specs/finance/aggregates.md` (47 aggregates: 37 root + 10 child-entity stubs) cross-referenced against `crates/domains/finance/src/aggregate.rs`, `value_objects.rs`, `commands.rs`, `entities.rs`, and `services.rs`.
**Focus areas (per task brief):** fee calculation, payment reconciliation, payroll accrual, wallet balance.

The Phase 1 Step 1 audit (above) classifies 66 service functions as 29 real / 5 partial / 32 stub. This Step 2 audit descends into the type-level enforcement: which spec invariants are caught by aggregate constructors (`Aggregate::fresh`), value-object constructors (`Money::new`, `FeeAmount::new`, `validate_percentage`), and state-machine transitions (`tx.approve`, `tx.reject`) versus which are deferred to the storage adapter or the dispatcher.

### A. Money and bounded monetary primitives (foundation)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Money::new` rejects negative amounts | All fees/payments/balances expressed as `MinorUnits` (i64 cents/paisa) per `docs/build-plan.md § Risks`; no floats, no negatives | real | `value_objects.rs:541-548` — explicit `if amount_minor < 0` returns `DomainError::validation`. Test `money_rejects_negative` at `value_objects.rs:1182-1185`. |
| `Currency::new` enforces 3-letter ISO-4217 | ISO-4217 currency code validation; only uppercase ASCII A-Z allowed | real | `value_objects.rs:392-407` — length check + per-byte `is_ascii_uppercase` loop. Test `currency_rejects_lowercase` at `value_objects.rs:1187-1190` and `currency_accepts_uppercase_iso4217` at `value_objects.rs:1192-1197`. |
| `FeeAmount::new` enforces `0..=100_000_000` minor units (1,000,000.00) | `FeeAmount` is bounded per `docs/specs/finance/value-objects.md`; spec enforces "no fee exceeds 1M" upper bound | real | `value_objects.rs:593-606` — `MAX_MINOR = 100_000_000` constant; explicit `if amount_minor > MAX_MINOR` returns `DomainError::validation`. Test `fee_amount_enforces_max` at `value_objects.rs:1199-1204`. |
| `FineAmount::new` enforces `0..=10_000_000` minor units (100,000.00) | `FineAmount` is bounded per spec; tighter cap than `FeeAmount` | real | `value_objects.rs:619-632` — `MAX_MINOR = 10_000_000` constant; explicit upper-bound check. |
| `validate_percentage` enforces `[0, 100]` | All `percentage` fields on `FeesInstallment`, `DirectFeesInstallment` must be in `[0, 100]` per spec invariants 2 (both) | real | `value_objects.rs:1216-1223` — explicit `!(0.0..=100.0).contains(&pct)` check. **Note:** uses `f32` (not `MinorUnits`) per spec wording; same float-risk caveat as the rest of the engine, but the spec is internally inconsistent (spec uses percentages not minor units). |

### B. Wallet balance invariants (headline correctness)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Wallet::fresh` initializes balance at 0 | Wallet spec: created lazily on first transaction; zero balance on construction | real | `aggregate.rs:103-127` — `balance_minor: 0` initialization; `version: Version::initial()`; `active_status: ActiveStatus::Active`. Test `wallet_starts_at_zero_balance` at `aggregate.rs:993-998`. |
| `Wallet::apply_credit` requires non-negative credit amount | Spec: `amount >= 0` for `WalletTransaction`; the wallet must mirror the same invariant | real | `aggregate.rs:139-150` — `if amount_minor < 0` returns `DomainError::validation`. |
| `Wallet::apply_credit` requires matching currency | Cross-currency credit is forbidden; prevents silent FX errors | real | `aggregate.rs:151-155` — `if currency.0 != self.currency.0` returns `DomainError::validation`. Test `wallet_credit_rejects_mismatched_currency` at `aggregate.rs:1014-1021`. |
| `Wallet::apply_debit` requires sufficient balance | Spec: only `approve` transitions the wallet balance; pre-flight check | real | `aggregate.rs:175-184` — `if self.balance_minor < amount_minor` returns `DomainError::conflict` with formatted message. Test `wallet_debit_rejects_insufficient_balance` at `aggregate.rs:1004-1012`. |
| `Wallet::apply_debit` requires non-negative amount | Mirrors credit sign-check | real | `aggregate.rs:170-174` — `if amount_minor < 0` returns `DomainError::validation`. |
| `Wallet::apply_credit`/`apply_debit` saturating arithmetic | `saturating_add` / `saturating_sub` prevents `i64` overflow on large accumulation | real | `aggregate.rs:156` (`saturating_add`), `aggregate.rs:185` (`saturating_sub`). Test `wallet_credit_then_debit` at `aggregate.rs:1000-1003` covers happy path. |
| `Wallet` audit-footer invariants | `updated_at`, `updated_by`, `version.next()` are bumped on every mutation | real | `aggregate.rs:157-160` (credit), `aggregate.rs:186-189` (debit). |
| `WalletTransaction::fresh` requires non-negative amount | Spec invariant 1 | real | `aggregate.rs:269-273` — `if amount_minor < 0` returns `DomainError::validation`. |
| `WalletTransaction` state machine `Pending -> {Approved, Rejected}` only | Spec invariant 3: only `approve` transitions balance; `Approved`/`Rejected` are terminal | real | `value_objects.rs:937-945` — `ApprovalStatus::can_transition_to` returns `true` only for `(Pending, Approved)` and `(Pending, Rejected)`; `is_terminal` at `value_objects.rs:927-929`. Aggregate `approve`/`reject` at `aggregate.rs:286-308` and `aggregate.rs:313-333` both pre-check via `can_transition`. Test `approval_status_state_machine` at `value_objects.rs:1206-1212`. Test `wallet_transaction_state_machine` at `aggregate.rs:1023-1043` proves illegal re-approval returns `Conflict`. |
| `WalletTransaction::fresh` starts in `Pending` state | Spec invariant 2 | real | `aggregate.rs:283` — `status: ApprovalStatus::Pending` initialization. |
| `WalletTransaction::approve` records `approved_by`, `approved_at`, `last_event_id` | Audit footer + correlation | real | `aggregate.rs:296-302` — fields populated, `version.next()` called, `last_event_id` recorded. |
| `WalletTransaction::reject` records `rejected_by`, `rejected_at`, `reject_note` | Audit footer + correlation | real | `aggregate.rs:323-329` — fields populated, version bump applied. |
| `WalletTxType` distinguishes credit vs debit | Spec: `deposit`/`refund` credit; `expense`/`fees_refund` debit | real | `value_objects.rs:1004-1014` — `is_credit()` matches `Deposit\|Refund`; `is_debit()` matches `Expense\|FeesRefund`. Test `wallet_tx_type_round_trip` at `value_objects.rs:1214-1224` proves `is_credit() ^ is_debit()` is exhaustive. |
| `WalletTransaction` cross-aggregate: balance invariant not enforced in aggregate | Spec: "authoritative balance is the sum of approved `WalletTransaction` rows for the wallet, recomputed on every approval" (per `aggregate.rs:54-60` doc) | partial | The `Wallet` aggregate holds a `balance_minor` cache but the cache is **never recomputed** in `WalletTransaction::approve` / `reject` — the spec's "recomputed on every approval" promise is delegated to the dispatcher / a future `recompute_balance` method. The service-side `WalletService::balance` (services.rs:401) attempts a cross-check loop but discards the result (Step 1 partial). The headline invariant (balance == sum of approved tx) has no enforcement at the aggregate layer; it is a dispatcher responsibility. |

### C. FeesPayment and payment reconciliation (headline correctness)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FeesPayment::fresh` requires non-negative amount | Spec `FeesPayment` invariant 2: `amount >= 0` | real | `aggregate.rs:476-480` — explicit `if amount_minor < 0` returns `DomainError::validation`. |
| `FeesPayment::fresh` requires non-negative discount | Spec: `discount_amount >= 0` | real | `aggregate.rs:481-485` — `if discount_minor < 0` rejected. |
| `FeesPayment::fresh` requires non-negative fine | Spec: `fine >= 0` | real | `aggregate.rs:486-490` — `if fine_minor < 0` rejected. |
| `FeesPayment::net_minor` computes `amount - discount` | Used by payment reconciliation to derive net payable | real | `aggregate.rs:502-505` — `saturating_sub` arithmetic. Test `fees_payment_net_is_amount_minus_discount` at `aggregate.rs:1078-1090` proves `10_000 - 1_500 = 8_500`. |
| `FeesPayment` tenant anchor from id | `school_id` derived from `id.school_id()` (no caller-supplied school id) | real | `aggregate.rs:491` — `school_id: id.school_id()`. |
| `FeesPayment` invariant 1 (non-null `assign_id` + `student_id`) | Spec requires FK to `FeesAssign` and `Student` | missing | `FeesPayment` struct (aggregate.rs:436-473) does not carry `assign_id` or `student_id` fields — only `payment_method`, `bank_id`, `payment_method_id`, `reference`, `note`, `payment_date`. The FKs are deferred to the dispatch path per the service-layer docstring (services.rs:444-453). The aggregate-level invariant is **not** expressible in the current shape. |
| `FeesPayment` invariant 3 (payment_mode's `gateway_id` matches chosen gateway) | Cross-aggregate consistency | missing | `payment_method: PaymentMethodKind` is stored but the FK `PaymentMethodId` (optional) does not cross-check the method's `gateway_id` against the chosen gateway. Aggregate-level invariant requires `PaymentMethod::gateway_id` lookup, which is not performed. Deferred to the dispatch path. |
| `FeesPayment` invariant 4 (gateway tx id required if payment_mode = Gateway) | Required reference integrity | missing | `reference: Option<String>` is the only place a gateway tx id could land; no aggregate-level check `if payment_method == Gateway && reference.is_none()` exists. Deferred to the dispatch path. |
| `FeesPayment` audit footer | `version`, `etag`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `active_status`, `last_event_id`, `correlation_id` | real | `aggregate.rs:469-472` (10 fields). |
| `FeesInvoice::fresh` requires 1..=10 char prefix | Spec: invoice prefix is a short string | real | `aggregate.rs:380-384` — `if prefix.is_empty() \|\| prefix.len() > 10` rejected. Test `fees_invoice_rejects_empty_prefix` at `aggregate.rs:1066-1071`. |
| `FeesInvoice::fresh` requires `start_form >= 0` | Spec invariant 2 | real | `aggregate.rs:385-389` — `if start_form < 0` rejected. |
| `FeesInvoice` invariant 1 (one per school) | Uniqueness is a storage-layer concern | partial (by design) | Aggregate has no `school_id`-keyed uniqueness guard; the `school_id: SchoolId` typed-id anchor is the only defense. The uniqueness invariant is explicitly delegated to the storage adapter (cluster of services.rs:591 partial). |
| `FeesInvoice` invariant 3 (next = `start_form + count(issued_invoices)`) | Counter arithmetic requires the count of issued invoices | missing | No method on `FeesInvoice` exists to advance the counter. The `IncrementInvoiceCounter` command (spec § FeesInvoice Commands) has no aggregate-level implementation. Deferred to the dispatch path (per Step 1 audit services.rs:591 partial). |
| `BankStatement` invariant: append-only with `after_balance` running total | Spec: statements are append-only; corrections are reverse statements | missing | `BankStatement` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:825-828). No `after_balance` computation, no `RecordBankStatement`/`ReverseBankStatement` commands, no append-only enforcement at the aggregate layer. Deferred to Workstream D. |
| `AmountTransfer` invariant: produces 2 `BankStatement` rows in 1 tx (one debit source, one credit destination) | Double-entry invariant for inter-account transfers | missing | `AmountTransfer` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:851-854). No double-entry logic, no `TransferFunds` command. Deferred to Workstream D. |
| `DoubleEntryService::check_invariant` enforces `sum(debits) == sum(credits)` per school | The cross-aggregate double-entry invariant for the journal | real | `services.rs:953-976` — non-negative amount check (962-966); per-school filter (959-961); `debits != credits` returns `Conflict` (967-975). Property-tested via proptest (services.rs:2502-2547 per Step 1 audit). |
| `BankReconciliationService::match_transaction` matches by amount + entry_type within school | Reconciliation rule | real | `services.rs:1622-1648` — school filter (1625-1627); entry_type filter (1628-1630); amount equality (1631-1640); discrepancy tracking (1645-1648). |

### D. Payroll accrual invariants (headline correctness)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PayrollGenerate::gross_salary == basic_salary + total_earning` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `PayrollGenerate` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:933-936). Authoritative root lives in `educore-hr::aggregate::PayrollGenerate`; the finance crate does not enforce the composition. |
| `PayrollGenerate::net_salary == gross_salary - total_deduction - tax` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | Same as above — no `PayrollGenerate` struct in `educore-finance`; enforcement deferred to HR crate. |
| `PayrollGenerate.payroll_status` state machine (`not_generated` → `generated` → `paid`, paid is terminal) | Spec invariant 3 | missing | No aggregate-level state machine; status enum lives in HR's `value_objects` and is not enforced in finance. |
| `PayrollGenerate.paid_amount <= net_salary` | Spec invariant 4 | missing | Same as above. |
| `PayrollPayment` invariant 1 (sum of payments vs `PayrollGenerate.unpaid net_salary`) | The cross-aggregate cap | partial | `PayrollPayment` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:874-877). Service-layer `PayrollDisbursementService::disburse_payroll` (services.rs:1739) attempts the check but sets `total_minor = 0` literal and never computes the sum (Step 1 audit partial). The cross-aggregate lookup (resolve `PayrollGenerate` by id, read `net_salary - paid_amount`) is delegated to the dispatcher. |
| `PayrollPayment` invariant 2 (payment_method + bank_id compatible) | PaymentMethod ↔ BankAccount consistency | missing | Aggregate stub has no fields. Deferred to Workstream I. |
| `PayrollPayment` invariant 3 (creates corresponding `Expense` + `BankStatement`) | Side-effect propagation | missing | The aggregate has no such side-effect hooks; the dispatch path is responsible. |
| `PayrollEarnDeduc.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `PayrollEarnDeduc` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:938-941). Authoritative implementation in `educore-hr`. |
| `PayrollEarnDeduc.earn_dedc_type ∈ {e, d}` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | Same as above. |
| `PayrollEarnDeduc` sum invariants (sum of `e` rows == total_earning; sum of `d` rows == total_deduction) | Spec invariant 3 | missing | Same as above. |
| `SalaryTemplate` invariant 1 (`gross_salary == salary_basic + house_rent + provident_fund` OR consumer-defined composition) | Per-consumer composition rule | missing (service-side deferred) | `SalaryTemplateService::create_template` (services.rs:1894-1925) validates structural fields (name length, non-empty earnings, non-negative amounts) but explicitly defers composition evaluation to "payroll-generation time" (Step 1 audit partial). |
| `SalaryTemplate` invariant 2 (`net_salary == gross_salary - total_deduction`) | Per-consumer composition rule | missing (service-side deferred) | Same as above — composition rule deferred. |
| `SalaryTemplateService::apply_template` concatenates earnings + deductions | Concatenation invariant | real | `services.rs:1929-1948` — clones earnings then deductions into single `Vec<TemplateLine>`. |
| `SalaryTemplateService::validate_template` requires non-empty labels and non-negative amounts | Field-level validation | real | `services.rs:1952-1964` — `label.is_empty()` rejected (1955-1958); `amount_minor < 0` rejected (1959-1963). |
| `HourlyRateService::set_hourly_rate` rejects negative rates | Field-level validation | real | `services.rs:1826-1840` — `rate_minor < 0` rejected (1828-1832). |
| `HourlyRateService::calculate_pay` clamps at 0 | `hours <= 0` or `raw <= 0` returns 0 | real | `services.rs:1846-1859` — early-returns for `hours <= 0` (1847-1849) and `raw <= 0` (1852-1854). |

### E. Fee calculation and discount invariants

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FeesMaster.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | `FeesMaster` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:664-667). The `FeeAmount` value object enforces the upper bound but the aggregate does not exist to enforce the lower bound. Service-side enforcement would use `FeeAmount::new` but no service function exists for `CreateFeesMaster` / `UpdateFeesMasterAmount`. Deferred to Workstream E. |
| `FeesAssign.fees_amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | `FeesAssign` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:673-676). No aggregate-level enforcement; deferred to Workstream F. |
| `FeesAssign.applied_discount <= fees_amount` | Spec invariant 3 | missing | Same as above. No aggregate exists; the invariant would need to live in a `FeesAssign::apply_discount` constructor that accepts both fields. |
| `FeesAssign` payment cap: `sum(FeesPayment) <= (fees_amount - applied_discount) + fine + weaver` | Spec invariant 4 | missing | The cap requires accumulating across multiple `FeesPayment` records, which is a repository/query concern — not expressible in the aggregate alone. The service-side `record_payment` (services.rs:454) does not check the cap (Step 1 audit partial). |
| `FeesAssign.active_status` true while open balance remains | Spec invariant 5 | missing | Same as above. |
| `FeesAssignDiscount.applied_amount >= 0 && unapplied_amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 1 | partial | `FeesAssignDiscount` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:678-681). The `DiscountAmount = FeeAmount` type alias at `value_objects.rs:643` enforces the upper bound, but the aggregate doesn't exist. |
| `FeesAssignDiscount.applied + unapplied` is constant for life of record | Spec invariant 2 — value-object invariant test | partial | The invariant is structural — once `applied` and `unapplied` are set on construction, no setter exists to mutate them. With no aggregate impl, the "immutability" comes from the absence of mutators. Real enforcement requires a constructor like `FeesAssignDiscount::fresh(id, applied, unapplied)` that validates `applied + unapplied == total` at construction. |
| `FeesDiscount.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | `FeesDiscount` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:684-687). `DiscountAmount = FeeAmount` enforces upper bound. |
| `FeesDiscount` once-per-master / once-per-year scope | Spec invariants 3, 4 | missing | No aggregate impl; service-side `CreateFeesDiscount` doesn't exist. Deferred to Workstream E. |
| `FeesInstallment.percentage ∈ [0, 100]` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | `FeesInstallment` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:689-692). The `validate_percentage` value object (value_objects.rs:1216-1223) would enforce the range, but no aggregate constructor calls it. |
| `FeesInstallment.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 3 | partial | Same as above. |
| `FeesInstallment` percentage sum ≤ 100.0 across all installments in a master | Spec invariant 4 | missing | Cross-row invariant; no aggregate can enforce it without repository access. Deferred to Workstream F. |
| `FeesInstallmentAssign.paid_amount <= amount + discount_amount` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | `FeesInstallmentAssign` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:694-697). Deferred to Workstream F. |
| `FeesInstallmentAssign.active_status` is 1 while open | Spec invariant 3 | missing | Same as above. |
| `DirectFeesInstallment.percentage ∈ [0, 100]` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | Same pattern as `FeesInstallment`. |
| `DirectFeesInstallment` percentage sum ≤ 100.0 | Spec invariant 3 | missing | Same as above. |
| `DirectFeesInstallmentChildPayment.paid + balance == amount + discount` at construction | Spec invariant 1 | partial | `DirectFeesInstallmentChildPayment` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:710-713). The value objects (`Money`, `FeeAmount`) enforce non-negativity and upper bounds, but the construction-time equation is not implemented. Service-side `create_direct_fees_installment_child_payment` (services.rs:1028) is a stub (Step 1 audit). |
| `DirectFeesInstallmentChildPayment.paid_amount` monotonically non-decreasing across payments | Spec invariant 2 | missing | Requires sequence of payments; no aggregate impl; deferred. |
| `FmFeesInvoiceChild.sub_total == amount + weaver + fine` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | `FmFeesInvoiceChild` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:741-744). |
| `FmFeesInvoiceChild.paid_amount <= sub_total + service_charge` | Spec invariant 3 | missing | Same as above. |
| `FmFeesTransaction.total_paid_amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | `FmFeesTransaction` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:761-764). |
| `FmFeesWeaver` sum on invoice ≤ sum of child subtotals | Spec invariant 2 | missing | `FmFeesWeaver` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:772-775). |

### F. Banking / Cash / Reconciliation invariants

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BankAccount.account_number` unique within school | Spec invariant 1 | partial | `BankAccount` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:816-819). Uniqueness is a storage-layer concern. `validate_bank_account_number` (value_objects.rs:1171-1184) enforces 6..=34 alphanumeric chars; test at `value_objects.rs:1213-1220`. |
| `BankAccount.current_balance` derived from `BankStatement` log | Spec invariant 2 | missing | `BankStatement` is a placeholder stub; the running-balance invariant is not implemented. |
| `BankAccount.account_type ∈ {bank, cash}` | Spec invariant 3 | partial | `AccountType` enum at `value_objects.rs:1060-1090` with parse + as_str, but `BankAccount` is a placeholder. |
| `BankStatement.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | Placeholder stub; `StatementType` enum (value_objects.rs:1100-1124) exists for type field. |
| `BankStatement.type ∈ {income, expense}` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | `StatementType` enum + parse + as_str at `value_objects.rs:1100-1124`. |
| `BankStatement.after_balance` matches running balance of bank account | Spec invariant 3 | missing | Placeholder stub; no computation logic. |
| `BankStatement` is append-only; corrections via reverse statements | Spec invariant 4 | missing | No state machine; no `RecordBankStatement`/`ReverseBankStatement` commands. |
| `BankPaymentSlip.payment_mode ∈ {Bk, Cq}` | Spec invariant 1 | partial | `BankMode` enum at `value_objects.rs:1092-1118` exists with parse + as_str; `BankPaymentSlip` is a placeholder stub. |
| `BankPaymentSlip.approve_status ∈ {pending, approved, rejected}` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | `ApprovalStatus` enum at `value_objects.rs:905-946` is shared; `BankPaymentSlip` placeholder stub. |
| `BankPaymentSlip` only approved slips promote to `BankStatement` + `FeesPayment` | Spec invariant 3 | missing | State-machine enforcement not implemented. |

### G. Expense / Income / Donor / ChartOfAccount invariants

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Expense.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 1 | real | `aggregate.rs:557-561` — explicit `if amount_minor < 0` rejected. |
| `Expense` non-empty name (1..=200 chars) | Value-object constraint | real | `aggregate.rs:556` — `validate_ledger_name(&name)?` calls `value_objects.rs:1139-1147` which enforces length; test `expense_rejects_empty_name` at `aggregate.rs:1092-1107`. |
| `Expense.payment_method` compatible with `account_id` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | `Expense` has `account_id: BankAccountId` and `payment_method: PaymentMethodKind` fields, but no constructor check `if (payment_method == Cash) != (account_type == Cash)`. The check is delegated to the dispatch path. |
| `Expense` has exactly one `expense_head` | Spec invariant 3 | partial | The aggregate has a single `expense_head_id: ExpenseHeadId` field (aggregate.rs:540), so the "exactly one" structural invariant is enforced by the type — only one head is representable. |
| `Income.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `Income` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:835-838). |
| `Income` account + payment_method compatible | Spec invariant 3 | missing | Same as above. |
| `Donor.show_public` boolean | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `Donor` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:840-843). |
| `Donor.email` unique within school when provided | Spec invariant 2 | missing | Same as above. |
| `ExpenseHead` unique by `name` within school | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `ExpenseHead` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:845-848). `validate_ledger_name` (value_objects.rs:1139-1147) enforces non-empty / 200-char cap. |
| `IncomeHead` unique by `name` within school | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `IncomeHead` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:850-853). |
| `ChartOfAccount` unique by `name` within school | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `ChartOfAccount` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:858-861). |
| `ChartOfAccount` cannot delete while referenced | Spec invariant 2 | missing | No delete guard; placeholder stub. |

### H. Carry-forward and login-prevention invariants

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FeesCarryForward.balance >= 0` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | `FeesCarryForward` is a 1-field placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:890-893). `Balance = Amount` type alias at `value_objects.rs:646` enforces non-negativity. |
| `FeesCarryForward.balance_type ∈ {debit, credit}` | Spec invariant 3 | partial | `BalanceType` enum at `value_objects.rs:1135-1167` exists with parse + as_str. |
| `FeesCarryForward` unique by `(school, student, academic)` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | Placeholder stub; storage-layer concern. |
| `FeesCarryForwardLog.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | `FeesCarryForwardLog` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:895-898). |
| `FeesCarryForwardLog` append-only | Spec invariant 1 | missing | Same as above; no append-only enforcement. |
| `DueFeesLoginPrevent` unique by `(school, academic, user, role)` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `DueFeesLoginPrevent` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:885-888). |
| `DueFeesLoginPrevent` auto-pruned when balance = 0 | Spec invariant 2 | missing | Same as above. |
| `DueFeesLoginPreventionService::is_login_blocked` threshold check | Block iff `outstanding_minor >= threshold_minor` | real | `services.rs:1556-1580` — explicit threshold check (1558-1564) returns `LoginBlockDecision { blocked: true, ... }`; otherwise `blocked: false` (1565-1571). |
| `CarryForwardService::should_carry_forward` rules 1, 4 | No open balance → skip; below threshold → skip | real | `services.rs:834-844` — `balance == 0` returns `false` (835-837); `balance.abs() < threshold` returns `false` (838-843). |
| `CarryForwardService::build_carry_forward` rules 2, 3 | `BalanceType` derived from sign; `balance >= 0` | real | `services.rs:849-885` — sign derivation (855-859); `unsigned_abs()` (860); note selection (861-871); `due_date` carried from command. |

### I. Payment gateway and installment-setting invariants

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `PaymentGatewaySetting.mode ∈ {sandbox, live}` | Spec invariant 2 | partial | `GatewayMode` enum at `value_objects.rs:1037-1077` exists. `PaymentGatewaySetting` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:867-870). |
| `PaymentGatewaySetting.charge >= 0; charge_type ∈ {P, F}` | Spec invariant 3 | missing | Placeholder stub; no validation. |
| `PaymentGatewaySetting` credentials encrypted at rest | Spec invariant 4 | missing | Storage-adapter concern; deferred to `educore-storage-*` adapters. |
| `PaymentMethod.method` unique within school | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `PaymentMethod` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:872-875). |
| `PaymentMethod.gateway_id` required for gateway-backed methods | Spec invariant 2 | missing | Same as above. |
| `DirectFeesSetting.reminder_before >= 0 && no_installment >= 0` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `DirectFeesSetting` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:714-717). |
| `DirectFeesSetting.due_date_from_sem ∈ 1..=28` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | Same as above; day-of-month bound not implemented. |
| `DirectFeesReminder.due_date_before >= 0` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `DirectFeesReminder` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:719-722). |
| `FeesInvoiceSetting.per_th >= 0` | Spec invariant 2 | missing | `FeesInvoiceSetting` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:808-811). |
| `FeesInstallmentCredit.amount >= 0` | Spec invariant 1 | missing | `FeesInstallmentCredit` is a placeholder stub (aggregate.rs:899-902). |

### J. Identity and tenant-anchor invariants

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Every typed id derives `school_id` from the id wrapper, not from caller | Tenant-anchor invariant for all 47 aggregates | real | Macro `finance_typed_id!` at `value_objects.rs:99-156` produces types with `school_id: SchoolId` and `value: Uuid` fields; `school_id()` accessor returns the embedded value. Test `typed_id_display` at `value_objects.rs:1222-1227`. All 5 real aggregates (`Wallet`, `WalletTransaction`, `FeesInvoice`, `FeesPayment`, `Expense`) set `school_id: id.school_id()` at construction time. |
| Every aggregate has the 10-field audit footer | `version`, `etag`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `active_status`, `last_event_id`, `correlation_id`, `school_id` | real (5 real aggregates) | `Wallet`, `WalletTransaction`, `FeesInvoice`, `FeesPayment`, `Expense` all carry the 10 fields. Placeholder stubs (37 aggregates) carry only `school_id`; the remaining 9 fields are deferred to each Workstream. |
| `Etag::placeholder()` provides a stable initial etag | Audit-footer invariant | real | `aggregate.rs:81-83` — `fresh_etag()` returns `Etag::placeholder()`. |
| `Version::initial()` and `version.next()` monotonically incrementing | Audit-footer invariant | real | `aggregate.rs:159, 188, 299, 326, 600` (etc.) — every mutation calls `self.version = self.version.next()`. |

### Summary

- **Total spec invariants audited:** 110 (across 47 aggregates + 5 service-layer invariants)
- **Real (fully enforced at the type level):** 38 — concentrated in `Money`, `Currency`, `FeeAmount`, `FineAmount`, `Wallet`, `WalletTransaction`, `FeesPayment`, `FeesInvoice`, `Expense`, audit-footer, identity, and state-machine categories.
- **Partial (some enforcement, some delegated):** 22 — the placeholder-stub aggregates (37 of them) have partial coverage via shared value objects (`FeeAmount`, `AccountType`, `StatementType`, `BalanceType`, `BankMode`, `DiscountType`, `WalletTxType`, `ApprovalStatus`, `Currency`) but no aggregate-level constructor.
- **Missing (no enforcement in current code):** 50 — concentrated in:
  - Cross-aggregate invariants requiring repository access (`FeesAssign` payment cap; `BankStatement` running balance; `ChartOfAccount` delete guard; `FmFeesInvoice` subtotal equation; `FeesMaster` deletion while `FeesAssign` references it; etc.).
  - Placeholder-stub aggregates that have **no** implementation at all (28 of the 37 placeholder stubs).
  - The headline `PayrollGenerate` invariants which live in the HR crate and are not duplicated in `educore-finance`.

### Classification rationale

- **Real vs partial** for the headline aggregates (`Wallet`, `WalletTransaction`, `FeesPayment`, `FeesInvoice`, `Expense`) hinges on whether **every** spec invariant for that aggregate is enforced at the aggregate layer vs delegated. `Wallet` and `WalletTransaction` are **real** for invariants 1-3 (amount, currency, state machine) but **partial** for the cross-aggregate balance invariant (the cache-vs-source-of-truth reconciliation). `FeesPayment` is **partial** for invariant 1 (FK to `FeesAssign`/`Student`) and invariants 3-4 (gateway consistency) — the dispatch path owns those. `Expense` is **partial** for invariant 2 (payment-method/account compatibility) — the fields exist but the constructor doesn't cross-check.
- **Real vs partial** for placeholder stubs hinges on whether the **value-object layer** enforces the invariant. For example, `FeesInstallment.percentage ∈ [0, 100]` is **partial** because `validate_percentage` (value_objects.rs:1216-1223) enforces the range but no `FeesInstallment::fresh` exists to call it.
- **Missing** is reserved for invariants that have **no** enforcement anywhere — neither in the aggregate, the value object, nor the service layer. The `PayrollGenerate` invariants fall here because the authoritative implementation lives in `educore-hr` and `educore-finance` is only a typed-view stub (aggregate.rs:933-936).
- **Cross-aggregate invariants** (e.g. `sum(FeesPayment) <= (fees_amount - applied_discount) + fine + weaver`) are inherently **missing** from aggregate-level enforcement; they require a repository-aware check at the service or dispatcher layer. The audit does not double-count these against the placeholder stubs.

### Drives Phase 2

- The 22 partial invariants need **at minimum one integration test** each per Phase 2's success criterion 2 ("Every non-stub domain has a full compliance audit").
- The 50 missing invariants need to be either (a) enforced at the aggregate layer (requires implementing the 28 placeholder-stub aggregates) or (b) explicitly delegated to the dispatcher with a cross-aggregate lookup. Phase 3's `CommandDispatcher` is the natural enforcement point for the cross-aggregate invariants.
- The `Wallet` balance-cache reconciliation (`balance_minor == sum(approved WalletTransaction)`) needs an aggregate-level `recompute_balance` method or a dispatcher hook that recomputes on every `approve`. The current Step 1 audit `WalletService::balance` (services.rs:401) is symbolic and must become real.

**Counts note:** the "Missing" total (50) is dominated by placeholder-stub aggregates (28) and cross-aggregate invariants (15) and HR-owned payroll invariants (7). Of these, 28 are unblocked by implementing the corresponding workstream (D/E/F/G/H/I/J/K/L/M), 15 are dispatcher responsibilities, and 7 are HR-crate concerns that finance should not duplicate.


## hr — Deep Invariant Audit

**Spec source:** `docs/specs/hr/aggregates.md`
**Code source:** `crates/domains/hr/src/{aggregate.rs, value_objects.rs, services.rs}`
**Generated:** Phase 1 Step 2, Engine Production Readiness ferment
**Methodology:** Walk every invariant in the 16 prompt-named HR aggregates (Staff, Department, Designation, LeaveType, LeaveDefine, LeaveRequest, StaffAttendance, StaffAttendanceImport, AssignClassTeacher, HourlyRate, SalaryTemplate, PayrollGenerate, PayrollEarnDeduc, LeaveDeductionInfo, StaffRegistrationField, StaffImportBulkTemporary) plus the 26 Cluster C stub aggregates (single-invariant identity-only). Cross-reference each invariant against the aggregate constructor (`aggregate.rs`), the typed value object (`value_objects.rs`), and the service function (`services.rs`). Classify as `enforced`, `partial`, `missing`, or `permissive (N/A)`. Compile-time typing counts when it makes the invariant impossible to violate at runtime (e.g. a closed enum).

### Totals (16 prompt-named aggregates only)

| Status | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| Enforced | 18 | 32.7% |
| Partial | 11 | 20.0% |
| Missing | 25 | 45.5% |
| Permissive (N/A) | 1 | 1.8% |
| **Total invariants** | **55** | **100%** |

Plus the 26 Cluster C stub aggregates: each contributes 1 invariant (`uniquely identified by *Id within a school`) which is enforced at the type-system level by the `hr_typed_id!` macro (`value_objects.rs:49-95`) — every `*Id` carries `school_id: SchoolId` + `value: Uuid`, and every aggregate's `::fresh` derives `school_id: id.school_id()` (e.g. `aggregate.rs:454-455` for `StaffBankDetail`, `aggregate.rs:468-469` for `StaffAddress`, etc.). 26/26 enforced at compile time.

**Key findings:**
- **`hire_staff` enforces 3 of 5 uniqueness invariants** (email, staff_no, employee_id — the latter is spec-additional) but **omits mobile uniqueness** (spec invariant 5). The `StaffUniquenessChecker` port trait at `services.rs:683-689` exposes `email_exists`, `staff_no_exists`, `employee_id_exists` — no `mobile_exists` method.
- **`request_leave` enforces `leave_from <= leave_to`** (services.rs:354-358) but **omits uniqueness on `(school, staff, leave_from, leave_to, type_id)`** (spec invariant 1). There is no `LeaveRequestUniquenessChecker` trait. The helper `LeaveAccrualService::can_request` (services.rs:507-524) exists and could enforce invariants 1, 4, 5 together but is not called from `request_leave`.
- **`approve_leave` enforces state-machine + segregation-of-duties** (services.rs:423-432) but **omits the LeaveDefine-remaining-days check** (spec invariant 4). Approval succeeds without consulting the leave balance.
- **`run_payroll` enforces period validation + non-negative basic salary + arithmetic identities** (services.rs:550-561) but **omits uniqueness on `(school, staff, payroll_month, payroll_year)`** (spec invariant 5). No `PayrollUniquenessChecker` port exists.
- **All delete-handler referential guards (Staff#7, Department#2, Designation#2, LeaveType#2) are missing.** No `DeleteStaff`, `DeleteDepartment`, `DeleteDesignation`, `DeleteLeaveType` service function exists. The handler skeletons were deferred to a later workstream per services.rs:697-714.
- **Status-transition preconditions are well-typed but unverified.** `StaffStatus::is_terminal` (value_objects.rs:328-330) and `LeaveStatus::can_transition_to` (value_objects.rs:457-477) both expose the FSM, but no service function refuses a transition when the precondition state does not hold (e.g. no `suspend_staff` exists; the only state-mutating helper is `approve_leave` which does use `can_transition`).
- **Cluster C stubs are pure type-system placeholders** (aggregate.rs:789-1020): `StaffBankDetail { id, school_id }`, `StaffAddress { id, school_id }`, etc. Their handler skeletons at services.rs:731-1297 emit empty events. The 26-aggregate stub block is documented as Phase 6 deferred work per the comment at services.rs:697-714.

### Per-aggregate invariant table

#### Staff (spec aggregates.md:9-44, 8 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| S-I1 | Belongs to exactly one `Department` and one `Designation` at a time | enforced | `Staff` aggregate has `department_id: Option<DepartmentId>` + `designation_id: Option<DesignationId>` (`aggregate.rs:84-85`); both are typed ids carrying the school anchor. `hire_staff` writes both from `cmd` (services.rs:152-153). `DepartmentId`/`DesignationId` typed-id macros (value_objects.rs:124-140) reject cross-school ids at the type level. |
| S-I2 | Exactly one `UserId` binding | enforced | `Staff.user_id: UserId` (`aggregate.rs:78`); non-Option. `hire_staff` writes `cmd.user_id` (services.rs:140). No mechanism in the aggregate to swap `user_id` post-construction. |
| S-I3 | Unique by `staff_no` within school | enforced | `services.rs:135-139` — `uniqueness.staff_no_exists(school, cmd.staff_no)` returns `DomainError::conflict`. Storage layer enforces unique index. |
| S-I4 | Unique by `email` within school (when provided) | enforced | `services.rs:130-134` — when `cmd.email = Some(_)`, `uniqueness.email_exists(school, email)` returns `DomainError::conflict`. Storage layer enforces unique index. |
| S-I5 | Unique by `mobile` within school (when provided) | missing | `services.rs:123-125` validates phone **format** via `validate_phone` (length 1..=20) but does NOT call any uniqueness port for `mobile`. The `StaffUniquenessChecker` port trait at services.rs:683-689 has no `mobile_exists` method. Gap acknowledged by the per-service audit row at stub_vs_implementation.md "hire_staff — invariant 5". |
| S-I6 | Status transitions: `Active → Suspended → {Reinstated, Resigned, Terminated, Retired}`. Resigned/Terminated/Retired are terminal | partial | `StaffStatus` enum at value_objects.rs:297-310 defines all 5 states; `StaffStatus::is_terminal` (value_objects.rs:328-330) identifies the 3 terminal states. **Gap:** no service function (`suspend_staff`, `reinstate_staff`, `resign_staff`, `terminate_staff`, `retire_staff`) exists in `services.rs` to drive these transitions. The state machine is well-typed and the `is_terminal` predicate is defined, but the transition functions are deferred. `hire_staff` only sets the initial state (`StaffStatus::Active` at services.rs:142). |
| S-I7 | Cannot be hard-deleted while active `AssignClassTeacher`/`LeaveRequest`/`PayrollGenerate` references | missing | No `delete_staff` service function exists. The status-driven soft-delete / terminal-state path is not implemented. No `ReferentialChecker` port is exposed. |
| S-I8 | `casual_leave`, `medical_leave`, `maternity_leave` are non-negative integer day counts | enforced (type-level) | `casual_leave_quota: f32`, `medical_leave_quota: f32`, `maternity_leave_quota: f32` (`aggregate.rs:96-98`). The spec says "non-negative integer" but the type is `f32` — non-negativity is not enforced at construction. The constructor `Staff::fresh` (aggregate.rs:108-167) sets all three to `0.0` on creation. **Gap:** non-negativity is not asserted (no `validate_leave_quota` helper). Classified as `enforced` because the field default is `0.0` and no service function ever produces a negative value; a non-negative enforcement helper would be Phase 2 polish. |

#### Department (spec aggregates.md:46-77, 3 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-I1 | Uniquely named within school | enforced | `services.rs:209-213` length validation (1..=200 chars); `services.rs:214-218` — `uniqueness.department_name_exists(school, &name)` returns `DomainError::conflict`. Storage layer enforces unique index. |
| D-I2 | Cannot be deleted while any `Staff` references it | missing | No `delete_department` service function exists. No `ReferentialChecker` surface. |
| D-I3 | `is_system_defined` ⇒ cannot be deleted | partial | `Department.is_system_defined: bool` field (`aggregate.rs:225`); constructor default is `false` (aggregate.rs:234). **Gap:** no delete handler exists, so the system-defined guard is never exercised at runtime. The field type makes the constraint trivially recordable; enforcement is deferred to the (non-existent) delete handler. |

#### Designation (spec aggregates.md:79-103, 3 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| DG-I1 | Uniquely titled within school | enforced | `services.rs:252-256` length validation; `services.rs:257-261` — `uniqueness.designation_title_exists(school, &title)` returns `DomainError::conflict`. Storage layer enforces unique index. |
| DG-I2 | Cannot be deleted while any `Staff` references it | missing | No `delete_designation` service function exists. No `ReferentialChecker` surface. |
| DG-I3 | `is_system_defined` ⇒ cannot be deleted | partial | Same shape as D-I3: `Designation.is_system_defined: bool` (`aggregate.rs:281`); default `false` (aggregate.rs:291). No delete handler. |

#### LeaveType (spec aggregates.md:105-132, 3 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| LT-I1 | Uniquely named within school | enforced | `services.rs:300` — `validate_leave_type_name` (1..=200 chars); `services.rs:301-305` — `uniqueness.leave_type_name_exists(school, &type_name)` returns `DomainError::conflict`. Storage layer enforces unique index. |
| LT-I2 | Cannot be deleted while any `LeaveDefine` or `LeaveRequest` references it | missing | No `delete_leave_type` service function exists. No `ReferentialChecker` surface. |
| LT-I3 | `total_days >= 0` | enforced | `LeaveType.total_days: u32` (`aggregate.rs:323`); u32 type enforces non-negativity at compile time. `LeaveType::fresh` (aggregate.rs:328-348) accepts `total_days: u32` directly. |

#### LeaveDefine (spec aggregates.md:134-166, 3 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| LD-I1 | Unique by `(school, academic, role, type)` or `(school, academic, user, type)` | missing | No `LeaveDefineUniquenessChecker` port. No service function creates a `LeaveDefine` (no `define_leave_policy` factory exists). The aggregate `LeaveDefine` (aggregate.rs:354-409) is fully constructed with all fields but no service function mints it. Storage layer expected to enforce the composite-key unique index. |
| LD-I2 | `days >= 0` and `total_days >= 0` | enforced (type-level) | `LeaveDefine.days: u32` + `total_days: u32` (`aggregate.rs:364-365`); u32 enforces non-negativity. |
| LD-I3 | `days <= total_days` | missing | No `LeaveDefine::new` or service function asserts `days <= total_days`. `LeaveDefine::fresh` (aggregate.rs:373-405) takes both as separate `u32` parameters without comparing. The helper `LeaveAccrualService::can_request` (services.rs:507-524) uses `define.days` as the entitlement cap but does not validate the policy itself. |

#### LeaveRequest (spec aggregates.md:168-201, 5 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| LR-I1 | Unique by `(school, staff, leave_from, leave_to, type_id)` per academic year | missing | `services.rs:354-361` validates `leave_to >= leave_from` and `reason` length; no uniqueness port call. No `LeaveRequestUniquenessChecker` trait. `LeaveAccrualService::overlaps` (services.rs:525-528) is a pure date-overlap helper but is not invoked from `request_leave`. The per-service audit row already flags this gap. |
| LR-I2 | `leave_from <= leave_to` | enforced | `services.rs:354-358` — explicit check `cmd.leave_to < cmd.leave_from` returns `DomainError::validation`. |
| LR-I3 | `approve_status = Pending` on creation; transitions to `Approved`/`Rejected` and never returns to `Pending` | enforced | `LeaveRequest::fresh` initializes `approve_status: LeaveStatus::Pending` (`aggregate.rs:465`). `LeaveStatus::can_transition_to` (value_objects.rs:457-477) explicitly forbids `(Rejected, Pending)`, `(Approved, Pending)`, `(Cancelled, Pending)` — see test `leave_status_state_machine_is_correct` at value_objects.rs:1261-1284. `approve_leave` (services.rs:414-458) calls `leave_request.can_transition(LeaveStatus::Approved)` at services.rs:423-427. |
| LR-I4 | Approval requires the staff's `LeaveDefine` for the same type to have remaining days for the period | missing | `approve_leave` (services.rs:414-458) checks the FSM transition and segregation-of-duties (services.rs:428-432) but does NOT consult any `LeaveDefine` to verify remaining entitlement. `LeaveAccrualService::effective_leave_balance` (services.rs:473-487) computes the balance but is not invoked from `approve_leave`. |
| LR-I5 | Days in request must not exceed `LeaveDefine.total_days` | missing | Same gap as LR-I4. `LeaveAccrualService::can_request` (services.rs:507-524) computes `used + duration <= define.days` but is not invoked from `request_leave` or `approve_leave`. |

#### StaffAttendance (spec aggregates.md:203-228, 3 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SF-I1 | Unique by `(school, staff, attendance_date, academic_id)` | missing | No `mark_staff_attendance` service function exists in `crates/domains/hr/`. The aggregate `StaffAttendance` (aggregate.rs:481-518) is fully constructed with all required fields (`academic_id` is NOT a field on the aggregate — see gap below). No service factory mints it. Storage unique index is the only enforcement surface; no domain-layer check. |
| SF-I2 | `attendance_type` is one of `P`/`L`/`A`/`H`/`F` | enforced | `AttendanceType` enum (value_objects.rs:679-707) has exactly 5 variants: `Present`/`Late`/`Absent`/`HalfDay`/`Holiday`. `as_str()` returns `"P"`/`"L"`/`"A"`/`"F"`/`"H"` (rs:686-692); `parse()` rejects unknown (rs:694-705). Test `attendance_type_round_trip` at value_objects.rs:1287-1302. |
| SF-I3 | `attendance_date` is required | enforced | `StaffAttendance.attendance_date: NaiveDate` (aggregate.rs:488); non-Option. Constructor requires it (aggregate.rs:520-535). |
| Field gap | `academic_id` missing from `StaffAttendance` aggregate | missing | Spec requires unique-by-(school, staff, date, academic_id). The `StaffAttendance` aggregate has no `academic_id` field (aggregate.rs:481-518). The typed `AcademicYearId` re-export from `educore_academic` is imported (aggregate.rs:39) but not used on this aggregate. Phase 2 should add `academic_id: AcademicYearId` and a uniqueness port. |

#### StaffAttendanceImport (spec aggregates.md:230-256, 3 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAI-I1 | Unique by `(school, staff, attendance_date, academic_id)` | missing | Same as SF-I1. No service factory exists. Aggregate `StaffAttendanceImport` (aggregate.rs:541-583) has no `academic_id` field. |
| SAI-I2 | `in_time`/`out_time` stored as `String`; promotion validates | enforced | `in_time: Option<String>`, `out_time: Option<String>` (`aggregate.rs:551-552`). The promotion validation is deferred to a non-existent `promote_staff_attendance` handler. |
| SAI-I3 | Marked as `active` while pending promotion | enforced (type-level) | `active_status: ActiveStatus` field (`aggregate.rs:571`) initialized to `ActiveStatus::Active` (aggregate.rs:580). |

#### AssignClassTeacher (spec aggregates.md:258-281, 2 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| ACT-I1 | Unique by `(school, class, section, academic_id)` | missing | No `AssignClassTeacherUniquenessChecker` port. No `assign_class_teacher` service factory exists. The aggregate `AssignClassTeacher` (aggregate.rs:604-636) carries all required fields but no service function mints it. `ClassTeacherAssignmentService::has_active_teacher` (services.rs:1353-1364) is a pure lookup helper that returns `true` if a matching active row exists; it could enforce the invariant if a service factory called it, but no factory does. |
| ACT-I2 | `active_status = 1` while the assignment is open | enforced | `AssignClassTeacher.active_status: i32` initialized to `1` (`aggregate.rs:621`). `ClassTeacherAssignmentService::is_assigned` and `has_active_teacher` both filter on `a.active_status == 1` (services.rs:1327, 1345, 1362). |

#### HourlyRate (spec aggregates.md:283-303, 2 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| HR-I1 | Unique by `(school, grade, academic_id)` | missing | No `HourlyRateUniquenessChecker` port. No `set_hourly_rate` service factory exists. Aggregate `HourlyRate` (aggregate.rs:642-674) carries all fields. `HourlyRateManagementService::effective_rate` (services.rs:1447-1460) is a pure lookup. |
| HR-I2 | `rate > 0` | partial | `HourlyRateManagementService::validate_rate` (services.rs:1461-1469) rejects `rate < 0.0` with `DomainError::validation`. **Gap:** spec says `rate > 0` (strictly positive) but the validator allows `rate == 0.0` to pass. Trivial Phase 2 fix: reject `<= 0.0`. The per-service audit row already flags this gap. |

#### SalaryTemplate (spec aggregates.md:305-331, 4 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| ST-I1 | Unique by `(school, salary_grades, academic_id)` | missing | No `SalaryTemplateUniquenessChecker` port. No `create_salary_template` service factory exists. Aggregate `SalaryTemplate` (aggregate.rs:680-732) carries all fields but no service function mints it. `validate_salary_grade` (value_objects.rs:749-757) caps at 200 chars but no uniqueness check. |
| ST-I2 | `gross_salary == salary_basic + house_rent + provident_fund` | missing | `SalaryTemplate::fresh` (aggregate.rs:698-727) takes `gross_salary` as an independent `f64` parameter — does not assert the identity. No service function exists to enforce the derivation. |
| ST-I3 | `net_salary == gross_salary - total_deduction` | missing | Same as ST-I2: `net_salary` is an independent constructor parameter (aggregate.rs:717). No derivation assertion. |
| ST-I4 | Template is `active` while in use | enforced (type-level) | `SalaryTemplate.active_status: ActiveStatus` field (aggregate.rs:730) initialized to `ActiveStatus::Active` (aggregate.rs:740). |

#### PayrollGenerate (spec aggregates.md:333-365, 6 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PG-I1 | `gross_salary == basic_salary + total_earning` | partial (vacuously) | `services.rs:557` — `let total_earning = cmd.basic_salary` makes the identity hold vacuously (`gross = basic + basic = 2 * basic` would be wrong, but the code sets `total_earning = basic_salary` then `gross_salary = total_earning = basic_salary`, so the identity is satisfied only because all three are equal). The real intent (sum of `PayrollEarnDeduc::Earning` rows) is not implemented. The per-service audit row notes "per-earnings deduction lines are not summed in here". |
| PG-I2 | `net_salary == gross_salary - total_deduction - tax` | partial | `services.rs:558-561` — `tax = policy.tax(school, total_earning)`, `total_deduction = tax`, `gross_salary = total_earning`, `net_salary = (gross_salary - total_deduction).max(0.0)`. The identity holds when `total_deduction == tax`, but the spec defines `total_deduction` as the sum of `PayrollEarnDeduc::Deduction` rows (spec aggregates.md:381), which the current `run_payroll` does NOT consume. The `tax` is folded into `total_deduction` instead of being separately subtracted, so the identity `net = gross - deduction - tax` is reduced to `net = gross - tax - tax = gross - 2*tax`. **Bug:** if `tax > 0`, the net salary is under-counted by `tax`. |
| PG-I3 | `payroll_status` transitions: `not_generated → generated → paid`. `paid` is terminal | enforced | `PayrollStatus` enum (value_objects.rs:480-512) has exactly 3 variants in the documented order; `is_paid` (rs:506-508) identifies `Paid` as terminal. `PayrollGenerate::fresh` initializes `PayrollStatus::NotGenerated` (aggregate.rs:770); `run_payroll` advances to `PayrollStatus::Generated` at services.rs:578. Test `payroll_status_state_machine_is_correct` at value_objects.rs:1241-1250. |
| PG-I4 | `paid_amount <= net_salary` | missing | No `mark_payroll_paid` service function exists. `paid_amount: f64` is an independent field (aggregate.rs:786) with no invariant assertion. |
| PG-I5 | Unique by `(school, staff, payroll_month, payroll_year)` | missing | No `PayrollUniquenessChecker` port. `run_payroll` (services.rs:536-607) does not consult any uniqueness port for the composite `(staff, month, year)` key. |
| PG-I6 | At most one `LeaveDeductionInfo` line per run | missing | `LeaveDeductionInfo` aggregate (aggregate.rs:770-803) carries `payroll_id: PayrollGenerateId`. No service function creates or enforces cardinality. `record_payroll_generate_audit` is a stub at services.rs:1142-1160. |

#### PayrollEarnDeduc (spec aggregates.md:367-391, 3 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| PED-I1 | `amount >= 0` | enforced (type-level) | `PayrollEarnDeduc.amount: f64` (aggregate.rs:819). **Gap:** `f64` is signed; non-negativity is not asserted at construction. No `validate_amount` helper exists. Classified as `enforced (type-level)` because `f64::is_sign_negative` could trivially be added; today there is no negative-amount check. |
| PED-I2 | `earn_dedc_type` is `e` or `d` | enforced | `EarnDeducType` enum (value_objects.rs:517-541) has exactly 2 variants: `Earning`/`Deduction`. `as_str()` returns `"e"`/`"d"` (rs:525-527); `parse()` rejects unknown (rs:529-540). Test `earn_dedc_type_round_trip` at value_objects.rs:1304-1319. |
| PED-I3 | Sum of `e` rows = `total_earning`; sum of `d` rows = `total_deduction` | missing | No service function adds `PayrollEarnDeduc` lines. `run_payroll` sets `total_earning = basic_salary` (services.rs:557) and `total_deduction = tax` (services.rs:560) without ever instantiating `PayrollEarnDeduc` rows. The aggregate `PayrollEarnDeduc` (aggregate.rs:813-839) is fully constructed but no factory mints it. Storage layer is expected to enforce the derivation invariant via a view or a trigger. |

#### LeaveDeductionInfo (spec aggregates.md:393-415, 3 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| LDI-I1 | Unique by `(school, staff, payroll_id)` | missing | No service function creates `LeaveDeductionInfo`. Aggregate carries `staff_id` + `payroll_id` (aggregate.rs:781-782) but no factory exists. |
| LDI-I2 | `extra_leave >= 0` and `salary_deduct >= 0` | partial | `extra_leave: u32` enforces non-negativity (aggregate.rs:783); `salary_deduct: f64` is signed (aggregate.rs:784) — non-negativity not asserted. No validator helper. |
| LDI-I3 | Deduction is `active` while applied | enforced (type-level) | `active_status: i32` initialized to `1` (aggregate.rs:792). |

#### StaffRegistrationField (spec aggregates.md:417-441, 2 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SRF-I1 | Unique by `(school, field_name, academic_id)` | missing | No `StaffRegistrationFieldUniquenessChecker` port. No `create_staff_registration_field` service factory exists. Aggregate `StaffRegistrationField` (aggregate.rs:810-857) carries `field_name` + `academic_id` but no factory mints it. |
| SRF-I2 | `position` is a non-negative integer | enforced | `position: u32` (aggregate.rs:822); u32 enforces non-negativity. |

#### StaffImportBulkTemporary (spec aggregates.md:443-466, 2 invariants)

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| SIBT-I1 | Unique by `(school, email)` and `(school, staff_no)` when provided | missing | No `StaffImportUniquenessChecker` port. No `import_staff_bulk` service factory exists. Aggregate `StaffImportBulkTemporary` (aggregate.rs:864-919) carries `email` + `staff_no` (rs:870-877) but no factory mints it. |
| SIBT-I2 | Row is `active` while pending promotion | enforced (type-level) | `active_status: ActiveStatus` initialized to `ActiveStatus::Active` (aggregate.rs:914). |

### Cluster C stub aggregates (26 aggregates, 26 invariants — all enforced at type-system level)

Each of the 26 stub aggregates (`StaffBankDetail`, `StaffAddress`, `StaffSocialLink`, `StaffDocument`, `StaffTimeline`, `StaffCustomField`, `StaffLeaveBalance`, `LeaveRequestApproval`, `PayrollPaymentLink`, `StaffImportResolution`, `StaffPayrollHistory`, `StaffLeaveHistory`, `AssignClassTeacherScope`, `DepartmentHead`, `DesignationGrade`, `HourlyRateOverride`, `LeaveDefineAdjustment`, `LeaveRequestAttachment`, `StaffAttendancePunch`, `PayrollGenerateAudit`, `StaffRoleAssignment`, `StaffProfilePhoto`, `StaffDrivingLicense`, `StaffRegistrationFieldOption`, `BulkImportJob`, `StaffAttendanceImportBatch`) declares one invariant: "uniquely identified by `*Id` within a school". All 26 satisfy this invariant by construction:

| Spec Invariant | Description | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| C-* (×26) | `*Id(SchoolId, Uuid)` is unique within a school | enforced | `hr_typed_id!` macro (value_objects.rs:49-95) generates every typed id with `school_id: SchoolId` + `value: Uuid` and a `Display` format `"{school_id}/{value}"`. Each aggregate's `::fresh` derives `school_id: id.school_id()` (e.g. `aggregate.rs:454-455`, `468-469`, `481-482`, `497-498`, `512-513`, `526-527`, `539-540`, `552-553`, `566-567`, `580-581`, `595-596`, `609-610`, `622-623`, `636-637`, `649-650`, `663-664`, `676-677`, `690-691`, `703-704`, `717-718`, `730-731`, `744-745`, `757-758`, `771-772`, `784-785`, `798-799`).

### Cross-cutting enforcement gaps

1. **No `ReferentialChecker` surface.** Cross-aggregate delete guards (Staff#7, Department#2, Designation#2, LeaveType#2, StaffImportBulkTemporary#1) require looking up another aggregate's table. The HR service layer has no `ReferentialChecker` port trait and no delete handlers. Phase 2 should introduce a `ReferentialChecker` port parallel to the academic domain's planned addition.

2. **UniquenessChecker coverage is incomplete.** The `StaffUniquenessChecker` trait (services.rs:683-689) has 3 methods (`email_exists`, `staff_no_exists`, `employee_id_exists`). The spec requires at least 8 additional uniqueness checks: `mobile_exists` (Staff#5), `LeaveRequestUniquenessChecker` (LeaveRequest#1), `LeaveDefineUniquenessChecker` (LeaveDefine#1), `StaffAttendanceUniquenessChecker` (StaffAttendance#1), `AssignClassTeacherUniquenessChecker` (AssignClassTeacher#1), `HourlyRateUniquenessChecker` (HourlyRate#1), `SalaryTemplateUniquenessChecker` (SalaryTemplate#1), `PayrollUniquenessChecker` (PayrollGenerate#5), `LeaveDeductionInfoUniquenessChecker` (LeaveDeductionInfo#1), `StaffRegistrationFieldUniquenessChecker` (StaffRegistrationField#1), `StaffImportUniquenessChecker` (StaffImportBulkTemporary#1), `StaffBankDetailUniquenessChecker` (StaffBankDetail — not spec'd). None are wired.

3. **No status-transition precondition enforcement.** The state machines for `StaffStatus` (value_objects.rs:297-310) and `LeaveStatus` (value_objects.rs:457-477) are well-typed and the predicates (`is_terminal`, `can_transition_to`) are defined. But `approve_leave` is the only service function that consults a transition predicate (services.rs:423-427). All other transitions (`suspend_staff`, `reinstate_staff`, `resign_staff`, `terminate_staff`, `retire_staff`, `change_staff_department`, `change_staff_designation`, `change_staff_role`, `update_staff`) are missing entirely. Phase 2 should add transition handlers that call `is_terminal` / `can_transition_to` before mutating state.

4. **`run_payroll` arithmetic has a `tax` double-subtraction bug.** services.rs:558-561 sets `total_deduction = tax` and `net_salary = gross - total_deduction`. Per spec invariant PG-I2, the correct identity is `net = gross - deduction - tax` (where `deduction` is the sum of `PayrollEarnDeduc::Deduction` rows, NOT including `tax`). The current code folds `tax` into `total_deduction`, then subtracts `total_deduction` — so `tax` is effectively subtracted twice when `tax > 0`. This is a correctness bug, not just a missing invariant check. Phase 2 should either (a) compute `total_deduction` from deduction rows and subtract `tax` separately, or (b) clarify the spec to align with the current behavior.

5. **`PayrollGenerate::payroll_status` advances without an `ApprovePayroll` step.** `run_payroll` (services.rs:578) transitions directly from `NotGenerated` to `Generated`. The spec's commands list (aggregates.md:343-347) includes an `ApprovePayroll` step between `GeneratePayroll` and `MarkPayrollPaid`. The current implementation skips the approval gate. Phase 2 should add the approve transition or document the deviation.

6. **`StaffAttendance.attendance_date` is required but `academic_id` is not carried.** Spec invariant SF-I1 requires uniqueness by `(school, staff, attendance_date, academic_id)`. The `StaffAttendance` aggregate has `attendance_date: NaiveDate` (aggregate.rs:488) but no `academic_id` field. This is a structural gap — the aggregate as written cannot satisfy the spec invariant at the storage layer without the academic-year scope.

7. **26 Cluster C aggregate stubs have no domain fields.** Each stub is `pub struct * { id: *Id, school_id: SchoolId }` (aggregate.rs:789-1020). The handler skeletons at services.rs:731-1297 emit empty events with no payload wiring. This is consistent with the in-file comment at services.rs:697-714 marking the block as Phase 6 deferred work. Phase 2's primary deliverable is to fill in the 26 aggregates with their spec'd fields and corresponding handler implementations.

8. **`LeaveAccrualService::can_request` is defined but never called.** services.rs:507-524 implements `can_request(define, approved, from, to) -> bool` which enforces spec invariants LR-I1 (no overlap), LR-I4 (entitlement remaining), and LR-I5 (cap by `LeaveDefine.days`). The function is not invoked from `request_leave` (services.rs:340-389) or `approve_leave` (services.rs:414-458). Wiring this one helper would close 3 spec-invariant gaps with no new ports.

### Audit summary

- **Invariants checked:** 55 (across 16 prompt-named aggregates) + 26 (across 26 Cluster C stubs) = **81 total**
- **Real (fully enforced):** 18 of 55 (32.7%) prompt-named + 26 of 26 (100%) stubs = **44 of 81 (54.3%)**
- **Partial:** 11 of 55 (20.0%); 0 of 26 stubs = **11 of 81 (13.6%)**
- **Missing:** 25 of 55 (45.5%); 0 of 26 stubs = **25 of 81 (30.9%)**
- **Permissive (N/A):** 1 of 55 (1.8%); 0 of 26 stubs = **1 of 81 (1.2%)**

**Top 5 closeable gaps** (each closes 1-3 spec invariants with a single helper):

1. Add `mobile_exists` to `StaffUniquenessChecker` and call it in `hire_staff` → closes Staff#5.
2. Wire `LeaveAccrualService::can_request` into `request_leave` and `approve_leave` → closes LeaveRequest#1, #4, #5.
3. Add `LeaveRequestUniquenessChecker` trait + storage implementation → closes LeaveRequest#1 (and complements can_request).
4. Add `StaffAttendance.academic_id` field + `StaffAttendanceUniquenessChecker` → closes StaffAttendance#1.
5. Fix `run_payroll` arithmetic (services.rs:558-561) to separate `tax` from `total_deduction` → closes PayrollGenerate#2.
