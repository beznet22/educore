# Documentation Operating System

This is the documentation operating system for the SMSCore school management system. It is a collection of markdown files organized in a hierarchical structure.

**SMScore is not a school application**.
It is a:

* Domain Engine
* Business Platform Crate
* DDD Framework
* Hexagonal Architecture Framework
* Event-Driven School Domain Kernel
* AI-Agent Execution Engine

The biggest mistake would be organizing docs around screens, pages, or UI features. Instead, organize around **domains, commands, aggregates, services, ports, events, and adapters**.

# New: Research Layer

Because you have Schoolify.

```text
research/
│
├── schoolify-analysis.md
│
├── academic-analysis.md
├── assessment-analysis.md
├── attendance-analysis.md
├── finance-analysis.md
├── hr-analysis.md
└── ...
```

Purpose:

Document business logic extracted from Laravel.

Example:

```text
How Schoolify admits students

How promotions work

How report cards work

How fee collection works
```

This prevents repeatedly reading Laravel code.

This structure reflects the reality of SMScore:

**Schoolify** = business knowledge source

**Migrations** = database truth

**Specs** = domain truth

**Architecture** = system map

**Commands** = AI execution surface

**Ports** = integration contracts

**Events** = system communication

**SMScore** = reusable Rust school-domain engine, not an application.
