//! The `Idempotency` sub-port — command deduplication.
//!
//! Per `docs/ports/storage.md` § 6 and
//! `docs/decisions/ADR-014-Idempotency.md`, every mutating
//! command carries an `IdempotencyKey` (a UUIDv7 supplied by the
//! caller). The engine stores the (school_id, command_type,
//! idempotency_key) → outcome mapping so a retried command
//! returns the same result without re-executing side effects.
//!
//! The trait exposes `record` (store a new outcome), `lookup`
//! (fetch the stored outcome for a key), and `exists` (cheap
//! check used by the dispatcher to decide whether to fast-path a
//! retry).
